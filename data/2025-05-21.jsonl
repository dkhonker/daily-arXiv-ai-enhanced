Non-MIP-based heuristics are less frequently\napplied due to the highly constrained nature of the problem, which makes even\nthe construction of an effective initial solution challenging. Papageorgiou et\nal. (2014) introduced a single-product MIRP as the foundation for MIRPLib,\naiming to provide a collection of publicly available benchmark instances.\nHowever, only a few studies that propose new methodologies have been published\nsince then. To encourage the use of MIRPLib and facilitate result comparisons,\nthis study presents a heuristic approach that does not rely on mathematical\noptimization techniques to solve a deterministic, finite-horizon,\nsingle-product MIRP. The proposed heuristic combines a variation of a Beam\nSearch algorithm with an Iterated Local Search procedure. Among the 72\ninstances tested, the developed methodology can improve the best-known solution\nfor ten instances within an acceptable CPU time."}

Nevertheless, existing approaches\npredominantly rely on subjective textual mental records, which can be distorted\nby inherent mental uncertainties, leading to inconsistent and unreliable\npredictions. To address these limitations, this paper introduces ProMind-LLM.\nWe investigate an innovative approach integrating objective behavior data as\ncomplementary information alongside subjective mental records for robust mental\nhealth risk assessment. Specifically, ProMind-LLM incorporates a comprehensive\npipeline that includes domain-specific pretraining to tailor the LLM for mental\nhealth contexts, a self-refine mechanism to optimize the processing of\nnumerical behavioral data, and causal chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance the\nreliability and interpretability of its predictions. Evaluations of two\nreal-world datasets, PMData and Globem, demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed methods, achieving substantial improvements over general LLMs. We\nanticipate that ProMind-LLM will pave the way for more dependable,\ninterpretable, and scalable mental health case solutions."}

Using DolusChat, a novel 65k-example\ndataset with paired truthful/deceptive responses, we identify three key factors\nthat determine the honesty of learned policies: amount of exploration during\npreference learning, lie detector accuracy, and KL regularization strength.

This paper proposes\na model-agnostic framework for enforcing input-dependent linear equality and\ninequality constraints on neural network outputs. The architecture combines a\ntask network trained for prediction accuracy with a safe network trained using\ndecision rules from the stochastic and robust optimization literature to ensure\nfeasibility across the entire input space. The final prediction is a convex\ncombination of the two subnetworks, guaranteeing constraint satisfaction during\nboth training and inference without iterative procedures or runtime\noptimization.

While our prior work\nSDformer established the first DTM-based framework to achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance in this domain, two critical limitations persist in existing DTM\napproaches: 1) their inability to capture multi-scale temporal patterns\ninherent to complex time series data, and 2) the absence of theoretical\nfoundations to guide model optimization. To address these challenges, we\nproposes a novel multi-scale DTM-based time series generation method, called\nMulti-Scale Discrete Transformer (MSDformer). MSDformer employs a multi-scale\ntime series tokenizer to learn discrete token representations at multiple\nscales, which jointly characterize the complex nature of time series data.\nSubsequently, MSDformer applies a multi-scale autoregressive token modeling\ntechnique to capture the multi-scale patterns of time series within the\ndiscrete latent space. Theoretically, we validate the effectiveness of the DTM\nmethod and the rationality of MSDformer through the rate-distortion theorem.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that MSDformer significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results\ndemonstrate that incorporating multi-scale information and modeling multi-scale\npatterns can substantially enhance the quality of generated time series in\nDTM-based approaches. The code will be released upon acceptance."}

Quantization-aware training (QAT)\naddresses these challenges by reducing model precision while maintaining\nperformance. However, the scaling behavior of QAT, especially at 4-bit\nprecision (W4A4), is not well understood. Existing QAT scaling laws often\nignore key factors such as the number of training tokens and quantization\ngranularity, which limits their applicability. This paper proposes a unified\nscaling law for QAT that models quantization error as a function of model size,\ntraining data volume, and quantization group size. Through 268 QAT experiments,\nwe show that quantization error decreases as model size increases, but rises\nwith more training tokens and coarser quantization granularity. To identify the\nsources of W4A4 quantization error, we decompose it into weight and activation\ncomponents. Both components follow the overall trend of W4A4 quantization\nerror, but with different sensitivities. Specifically, weight quantization\nerror increases more rapidly with more training tokens. Further analysis shows\nthat the activation quantization error in the FC2 layer, caused by outliers, is\nthe primary bottleneck of W4A4 QAT quantization error. By applying\nmixed-precision quantization to address this bottleneck, we demonstrate that\nweight and activation quantization errors can converge to similar levels.\nAdditionally, with more training data, weight quantization error eventually\nexceeds activation quantization error, suggesting that reducing weight\nquantization error is also important in such scenarios.

This framework combines the\npredictive power of DL with the interpretability of traditional SD models,\nresulting in both causal reliability and scalability.

In this work, we prove general\nresults -- the first of their kind -- by applying Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)\ntheory to analyse infinitely-wide neural networks trained until convergence and\nprove that the inclusion of just one Layer Norm (LN) fundamentally alters the\ninduced NTK, transforming it into a bounded-variance kernel. As a result, the\noutput of an infinitely wide network with at least one LN remains bounded, even\non inputs far from the training data. In contrast, we show that a broad class\nof networks without LN can produce pathologically large outputs for certain\ninputs. We support these theoretical findings with empirical experiments on\nfinite-width networks, demonstrating that while standard NNs often exhibit\nuncontrolled growth outside the training domain, a single LN layer effectively\nmitigates this instability.

It requires\nunderstanding the underlying causes behind chains of events and conducting\ncausal inference for arbitrary unseen distributions. So far, this task eludes\nfoundation models, notably large language models (LLMs), which do not have\ndemonstrated causal reasoning capabilities beyond the memorization of existing\ncausal relationships. Furthermore, evaluating counterfactuals in real-world\napplications is challenging since only the factual world is observed, limiting\nevaluation to synthetic datasets. We address these problems by explicitly\nextracting and modeling causal relationships and propose the Causal\nCartographer framework. First, we introduce a graph retrieval-augmented\ngeneration agent tasked to retrieve causal relationships from data. This\napproach allows us to construct a large network of real-world causal\nrelationships that can serve as a repository of causal knowledge and build\nreal-world counterfactuals. In addition, we create a counterfactual reasoning\nagent constrained by causal relationships to perform reliable step-by-step\ncausal inference. We show that our approach can extract causal knowledge and\nimprove the robustness of LLMs for causal reasoning tasks while reducing\ninference costs and spurious correlations."}

Instead of relying on heuristic feature/metric construction, the\nsystem identification approach allows treating vector time series clustering by\nexplicitly considering their underlying autoregressive dynamics. We first\nderive a clustering algorithm based on a mixture autoregressive model.\nUnfortunately it turns out to have significant computational problems.

Today, coordination\nis usually handled with imprecise, ad-hoc natural language, which limits\ncomplex interaction and hinders interoperability with domain-specific agents.\nWe introduce Agent context protocols (ACPs): a domain- and agent-agnostic\nfamily of structured protocols for agent-agent communication, coordination, and\nerror handling.
