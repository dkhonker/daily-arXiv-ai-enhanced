Previous work\nwere mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some\npredefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of\nthe original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,\nthey largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of\nsubregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and\nsimilar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the\ncoarsened graph.

Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive\ngranular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original\ngraph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal\ngranularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as\nsupernodes. In addition, compared with other state-of-the-art graph coarsening\nmethods, the processing speed of this method can be increased by tens to\nhundreds of times and has lower time complexity.

In this\nstudy, we propose FEAT, a cost-effective framework for generating teacher\nfeedback, and have constructed three complementary datasets: (1) DIRECT-Manual\n(DM), where both humans and large language models (LLMs) collaboratively\ngenerate high-quality teacher feedback, albeit at a higher cost; (2)\nDIRECT-Generated (DG), an LLM-only generated, cost-effective dataset with lower\nquality;, and (3) DIRECT-Augmented (DA), primarily based on DG with a small\nportion of DM added to enhance quality while maintaining cost-efficiency.\nExperimental results showed that incorporating a small portion of DM (5-10%)\ninto DG leads to superior performance compared to using 100% DM alone."}

Despite these\nadvances, it is unclear whether transformers are able to learn and implement\nprecise algorithms. Here, we demonstrate that transformers can exactly\nimplement a fundamental and widely used algorithm for $k$-means clustering:\nLloyd's algorithm. First, we theoretically prove the existence of such a\ntransformer architecture, which we term the $k$-means transformer, that exactly\nimplements Lloyd's algorithm for $k$-means clustering using the standard\ningredients of modern transformers: attention and residual connections. Next,\nwe numerically implement this transformer and demonstrate in experiments the\nexact correspondence between our architecture and Lloyd's algorithm, providing\na fully neural implementation of $k$-means clustering. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat interpretable alterations (e.g., incorporating layer normalizations or\nmultilayer perceptrons) to this architecture yields diverse and novel variants\nof clustering algorithms, such as soft $k$-means, spherical $k$-means, trimmed\n$k$-means, and more.

It proposes a detection method based on federated\ncontrastive learning. The goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional\ncentralized approaches in terms of data privacy, node heterogeneity, and\nanomaly pattern recognition. The proposed method combines the distributed\ncollaborative modeling capabilities of federated learning with the feature\ndiscrimination enhancement of contrastive learning. It builds embedding\nrepresentations on local nodes and constructs positive and negative sample\npairs to guide the model in learning a more discriminative feature space.\nWithout exposing raw data, the method optimizes a global model through a\nfederated aggregation strategy. Specifically, the method uses an encoder to\nrepresent local behavior data in high-dimensional space. This includes system\nlogs, operational metrics, and system calls. The model is trained using both\ncontrastive loss and classification loss to improve its ability to detect\nfine-grained anomaly patterns. The method is evaluated under multiple typical\nattack types. It is also tested in a simulated real-time data stream scenario\nto examine its responsiveness. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod outperforms existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. It\ndemonstrates strong detection accuracy and adaptability, effectively addressing\ncomplex anomalies in distributed environments. Through careful design of key\nmodules and optimization of the training mechanism, the proposed method\nachieves a balance between privacy preservation and detection performance.

While the use of LLMs\nis explored for KG construction, handcrafting reasonable task-specific prompts\nfor LLMs is a labour-intensive exercise and can be brittle due to subtle\nchanges in the LLM models employed. Recent work in NLP tasks (e.g. autonomy\ngeneration) uses automatic prompt optimization/engineering to address this\nchallenge by generating optimal or near-optimal task-specific prompts given\ninput-output examples.\n  This empirical study explores the application of automatic prompt\noptimization for the triple extraction task using experimental benchmarking. We\nevaluate different settings by changing (a) the prompting strategy, (b) the LLM\nbeing used for prompt optimization and task execution, (c) the number of\ncanonical relations in the schema (schema complexity), (d) the length and\ndiversity of input text, (e) the metric used to drive the prompt optimization,\nand (f) the dataset being used for training and testing. We evaluate three\ndifferent automatic prompt optimizers, namely, DSPy, APE, and TextGrad and use\ntwo different triple extraction datasets, SynthIE and REBEL. Through rigorous\nempirical evaluation, our main contribution highlights that automatic prompt\noptimization techniques can generate reasonable prompts similar to humans for\ntriple extraction. In turn, these optimized prompts achieve improved results,\nparticularly with increasing schema complexity and text size."}

Despite rapid\nadvancements in MU technology, its vulnerabilities are still underexplored,\nposing potential risks of privacy breaches through leaks of ostensibly\nunlearned information. Current limited research on MU attacks requires access\nto original models containing privacy data, which violates the critical\nprivacy-preserving objective of MU. To address this gap, we initiate an\ninnovative study on recalling the forgotten class memberships from unlearned\nmodels (ULMs) without requiring access to the original one. Specifically, we\nimplement a Membership Recall Attack (MRA) framework with a teacher-student\nknowledge distillation architecture, where ULMs serve as noisy labelers to\ntransfer knowledge to student models. Then, it is translated into a Learning\nwith Noisy Labels (LNL) problem for inferring the correct labels of the\nforgetting instances. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MU methods with\nmultiple real datasets demonstrate that the proposed MRA strategy exhibits high\nefficacy in recovering class memberships of unlearned instances. As a result,\nour study and evaluation have established a benchmark for future research on MU\nvulnerabilities."}

Geneticists use this data to\nbuild models that predict how a genetic variant impacts phenotype given genomic\nfeatures of the variant, like DNA accessibility or the presence of nearby\nDNA-bound proteins.

Previous methods have therefore been restricted to fitting\nsmall models, and fitting simplified summary statistics, rather than the full\nlikelihood of the statistical model. In this paper, we leverage modern fast\nlinear algebra techniques to develop DeepWAS (Deep genome Wide Association\nStudies), a method to train large and flexible neural network predictive models\nto optimize likelihood.

For the aforementioned challenges,\nwe propose the Feature-Adaptive Time Series Forecasting Framework (FAF), which\nconsists of three key components: the Generalized Knowledge Module (GKM), the\nTask-Specific Module (TSM), and the Rank Module (RM). During training phase,\nthe GKM is updated through a meta-learning mechanism that enables the model to\nextract generalized features across related tasks. Meanwhile, the TSM is\ntrained to capture diverse local dynamics through multiple functional regions,\neach of which learns specific features from individual tasks. During testing\nphase, the RM dynamically selects the most relevant functional region from the\nTSM based on input sequence features, which is then combined with the\ngeneralized knowledge learned by the GKM to generate accurate forecasts. This\ndesign enables FAF to achieve robust and personalized forecasting even with\nsparse historical observations We evaluate FAF on five diverse real-world\ndatasets under few-shot time series forecasting settings.

In this work, we\nintroduce the Parametric Hypernetwork for Learning Interpolated Networks\n(PHLieNet), a framework that simultaneously learns: (a) a global mapping from\nthe parameter space to a nonlinear embedding and (b) a mapping from the\ninferred embedding to the weights of a dynamics propagation network. The\nlearned embedding serves as a latent representation that modulates a base\nnetwork, termed the hypernetwork, enabling it to generate the weights of a\ntarget network responsible for forecasting the system's state evolution\nconditioned on the previous time history. By interpolating in the space of\nmodels rather than observations, PHLieNet facilitates smooth transitions across\nparameterized system behaviors, enabling a unified model that captures the\ndynamic behavior across a broad range of system parameterizations.

A model,\ninitially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,\nnow employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of\ncomplexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.\nAdditionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and\nGPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural\nexecution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant\nimplications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion\nof thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a\nconsequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action."}

A key question is\nwhen probability flow converges to training samples or more general points on\nthe data manifold.

For\nintuition, we introduce a simpler score flow and show that for orthogonal\ndatasets, both flows follow similar trajectories, converging to a training\npoint or a sum of training points. However, early stopping by the diffusion\ntime scheduler allows probability flow to reach more general manifold points.\nThis reflects the tendency of diffusion models to both memorize training\nsamples and generate novel points that combine aspects of multiple samples,\nmotivating our study of such behavior in simplified settings. We extend these\nresults to obtuse simplex data and, through simulations in the orthogonal case,\nconfirm that probability flow converges to a training point, a sum of training\npoints, or a manifold point.
