When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans\nare utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading\nto further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a\nuser-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study\nproposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous\ndescriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT)\nresults, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or\nring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS)\nsoftware and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first\nleverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan\ndescriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and\nphase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python\nscripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic\nsignal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan.\nWithin a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan\nediting. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of\nover 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300\nplan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of\nunderstanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an\neasy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers,\nserving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile\napplication of LLMs in the field of ITS.

While prior work has developed\nvarious auditing methods, their resilience against dedicated adversarial\nattacks remains largely unexplored. To bridge the gap, this paper initiates a\ncomprehensive study evaluating dataset auditing from an adversarial\nperspective. We start with introducing a novel taxonomy, classifying existing\nmethods based on their reliance on internal features (IF) (inherent to the\ndata) versus external features (EF) (artificially introduced for auditing).\nSubsequently, we formulate two primary attack types: evasion attacks, designed\nto conceal the use of a dataset, and forgery attacks, intending to falsely\nimplicate an unused dataset.

In the\nabsence of this domain knowledge, the causal structure must be discovered from\nthe available observational data. However, observational data are often\ncompatible with multiple causal graphs, making methods that commit to a single\nstructure prone to overconfidence. A principled way to manage this structural\nuncertainty is via Bayesian inference, which averages over a posterior\ndistribution on possible causal structures and functional mechanisms.\nUnfortunately, the number of causal structures grows super-exponentially with\nthe number of nodes in the graph, making computations intractable. We propose\nto circumvent these challenges by using meta-learning to create an end-to-end\nmodel: the Model-Averaged Causal Estimation Transformer Neural Process\n(MACE-TNP). The model is trained to predict the Bayesian model-averaged\ninterventional posterior distribution, and its end-to-end nature bypasses the\nneed for expensive calculations.

We introduce a novel data-driven model, a\nconditional graph neural network (cGNN) to tackle this complexity. Our model\ntakes surface points and the location of applied forces, and is specifically\ndesigned to predict the deformation of the points and the forces exerted on\nthem.

This paper presents a comparative analysis of two\ncore post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement\nfine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge\nretention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising\nseven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base\nmodel for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant\nfindings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to\ncatastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks.

(2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the\nmodel's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).\nConversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis\nshows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought\nreasoning, are not the primary factors.

From a data-centric\nperspective addressing this limitation, we study diffusion dataset condensation\nas a new and challenging problem setting. The goal is to construct a\n\"synthetic\" sub-dataset with significantly fewer samples than the original\ndataset, enabling high-quality diffusion model training with greatly reduced\ncost. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formally investigate\ndataset condensation for diffusion models, whereas prior work focused on\ntraining discriminative models. To tackle this new challenge, we propose a\nnovel Diffusion Dataset Condensation (D2C) framework, which consists of two\nphases: Select and Attach. The Select phase identifies a compact and diverse\nsubset using a diffusion difficulty score and interval sampling. The Attach\nphase enhances the selected subset by attaching rich semantic and visual\nrepresentations to strengthen the conditional signals. Extensive experiments\nacross various dataset sizes, model architectures, and resolutions show that\nour D2C framework enables significantly faster diffusion model training with\ndramatically fewer data, while preserving high visual quality.

To bridge the gap, this paper initiates a\ncomprehensive study evaluating dataset auditing from an adversarial\nperspective. We start with introducing a novel taxonomy, classifying existing\nmethods based on their reliance on internal features (IF) (inherent to the\ndata) versus external features (EF) (artificially introduced for auditing).\nSubsequently, we formulate two primary attack types: evasion attacks, designed\nto conceal the use of a dataset, and forgery attacks, intending to falsely\nimplicate an unused dataset.

To address this, we propose Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding\n(CoRE), a series of hidden states in latent space to enable label-free\nself-evaluation on intermediate reasoning steps of LRMs, so as to enhance\nmetacognition abilities for improved reasoning efficiency. By analyzing the\ngeometric properties of the CoRE trajectories, we reveal that redundant\nreasoning usually presents cyclical fluctuations, which correspond to\nrepetitive and unconscious reflection/exploration. Leveraging this insight, we\nfurther introduce a training-free, label-free self-evaluation framework,\nCoRE-Eval, to detect such patterns and dynamically determine whether to\nterminate reasoning early. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME) and across model sizes from 7B to 32B\ndemonstrate that CoRE-Eval reduces chain-of-thought length by 13.7% to 33.2%\nwhile improving answer accuracy by around 10%, achieving 70.0% accuracy on the\nchallenging AIME benchmark with the 32B model."}

We start with introducing a novel taxonomy, classifying existing\nmethods based on their reliance on internal features (IF) (inherent to the\ndata) versus external features (EF) (artificially introduced for auditing).\nSubsequently, we formulate two primary attack types: evasion attacks, designed\nto conceal the use of a dataset, and forgery attacks, intending to falsely\nimplicate an unused dataset. Building on the understanding of existing methods\nand attack objectives, we further propose systematic attack strategies:\ndecoupling, removal, and detection for evasion; adversarial example-based\nmethods for forgery. These formulations and strategies lead to our new\nbenchmark, DATABench, comprising 17 evasion attacks, 5 forgery attacks, and 9\nrepresentative auditing methods. Extensive evaluations using DATABench reveal\nthat none of the evaluated auditing methods are sufficiently robust or\ndistinctive under adversarial settings. These findings underscore the urgent\nneed for developing a more secure and reliable dataset auditing method capable\nof withstanding sophisticated adversarial manipulation. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/shaoshuo-ss/DATABench."}

Our framework\nachieves significant performance gains through a hierarchical optimization\nstrategy executed entirely on the server: first, FHE-compatible node importance\nscores (based on encrypted degree statistics) are computed from the encrypted\ngraph. These scores then guide a homomorphic partitioning process, generating\nmulti-level importance masks directly under FHE.
