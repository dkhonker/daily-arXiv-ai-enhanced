When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans\nare utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading\nto further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a\nuser-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study\nproposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous\ndescriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT)\nresults, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or\nring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS)\nsoftware and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first\nleverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan\ndescriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and\nphase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python\nscripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic\nsignal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan.\nWithin a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan\nediting. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of\nover 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300\nplan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of\nunderstanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an\neasy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers,\nserving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile\napplication of LLMs in the field of ITS.

While prior work has developed\nvarious auditing methods, their resilience against dedicated adversarial\nattacks remains largely unexplored. To bridge the gap, this paper initiates a\ncomprehensive study evaluating dataset auditing from an adversarial\nperspective. We start with introducing a novel taxonomy, classifying existing\nmethods based on their reliance on internal features (IF) (inherent to the\ndata) versus external features (EF) (artificially introduced for auditing).\nSubsequently, we formulate two primary attack types: evasion attacks, designed\nto conceal the use of a dataset, and forgery attacks, intending to falsely\nimplicate an unused dataset.

Compared to other state-of-the-art deep learning systems, AXLearn has a\nunique focus on modularity and support for heterogeneous hardware\ninfrastructure. AXLearn's internal interfaces between software components\nfollow strict encapsulation, allowing different components to be assembled to\nfacilitate rapid model development and experimentation on heterogeneous compute\ninfrastructure. We introduce a novel method of quantifying modularity via\nLines-of-Code (LoC)-complexity, which demonstrates how our system maintains\nconstant complexity as we scale the components in the system, compared to\nlinear or quadratic complexity in other systems. This allows integrating\nfeatures such as Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) into AXLearn across hundred\nof modules with just 10 lines of code, compared to hundreds as required in\nother systems. At the same time, AXLearn maintains equivalent performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art training systems. Finally, we share our experience\nin the development and operation of AXLearn."}

OpenAgentSafety is\ndesigned for extensibility, allowing researchers to add tools, tasks, websites,\nand adversarial strategies with minimal effort. It combines rule-based analysis\nwith LLM-as-judge assessments to detect both overt and subtle unsafe behaviors.\nEmpirical analysis of five prominent LLMs in agentic scenarios reveals unsafe\nbehavior in 51.2% of safety-vulnerable tasks with Claude-Sonnet-3.7, to 72.7%\nwith o3-mini, highlighting critical safety vulnerabilities and the need for\nstronger safeguards before real-world deployment."}

To bridge the gap, this paper initiates a\ncomprehensive study evaluating dataset auditing from an adversarial\nperspective. We start with introducing a novel taxonomy, classifying existing\nmethods based on their reliance on internal features (IF) (inherent to the\ndata) versus external features (EF) (artificially introduced for auditing).\nSubsequently, we formulate two primary attack types: evasion attacks, designed\nto conceal the use of a dataset, and forgery attacks, intending to falsely\nimplicate an unused dataset. Building on the understanding of existing methods\nand attack objectives, we further propose systematic attack strategies:\ndecoupling, removal, and detection for evasion; adversarial example-based\nmethods for forgery. These formulations and strategies lead to our new\nbenchmark, DATABench, comprising 17 evasion attacks, 5 forgery attacks, and 9\nrepresentative auditing methods.

However, mitigating toxicity during\nthis customization, especially when dealing with untrusted training data,\nremains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce TuneShield, a\ndefense framework designed to mitigate toxicity during chatbot fine-tuning\nwhile preserving conversational quality. TuneShield leverages LLM-based\ntoxicity classification, utilizing the instruction-following capabilities and\nsafety alignment of LLMs to effectively identify toxic samples, outperforming\nindustry API services. TuneShield generates synthetic conversation samples,\ntermed 'healing data', based on the identified toxic samples, using them to\nmitigate toxicity while reinforcing desirable behavior during fine-tuning. It\nperforms an alignment process to further nudge the chatbot towards producing\ndesired responses. Our findings show that TuneShield effectively mitigates\ntoxicity injection attacks while preserving conversational quality, even when\nthe toxicity classifiers are imperfect or biased. TuneShield proves to be\nresilient against adaptive adversarial and jailbreak attacks. Additionally,\nTuneShield demonstrates effectiveness in mitigating adaptive toxicity injection\nattacks during dialog-based learning (DBL)."}

DESIGN tackles the critical\nefficiency limitations of existing FHE GNN approaches, which often overlook\ninput data redundancy and apply uniform computational strategies. Our framework\nachieves significant performance gains through a hierarchical optimization\nstrategy executed entirely on the server: first, FHE-compatible node importance\nscores (based on encrypted degree statistics) are computed from the encrypted\ngraph. These scores then guide a homomorphic partitioning process, generating\nmulti-level importance masks directly under FHE. This dynamically generated\nmask facilitates both input graph pruning (by logically removing unimportant\nelements) and a novel adaptive polynomial activation scheme, where activation\ncomplexity is tailored to node importance levels.
