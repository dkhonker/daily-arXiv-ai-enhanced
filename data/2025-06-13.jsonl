When an AI system is engineered for deductively\nwatertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of\nits outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be\nnarrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input\nhigh-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary\ngenerative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error\nperformance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By\nmaking this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous\nverification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions\nand philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical\nmotivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in\ninformation-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in\nepistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then\noffers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of\nunderdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The\ndiscussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape\nevaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The\nconclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the\ninequality for the future of trustworthy AI."}

For\ntransparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing\nintentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing\nquantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient.

This practice is\nstatistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic\nsubgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional\nanalyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving\nrise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more\ngranular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable\nestimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,\nprecluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.\n  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing\nframework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical\ndecision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we\nprove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to\nanalytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive)\nerror is guaranteed at level $\\alpha$. (ii) For the long tail of small\nintersectional groups, we derive a fully Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial\nestimator; Monte-Carlo credible intervals are calibrated for any sample size\nand naturally converge to Wald intervals as more data becomes available.

This practice is\nstatistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic\nsubgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional\nanalyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving\nrise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more\ngranular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable\nestimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,\nprecluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.\n  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing\nframework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical\ndecision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we\nprove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to\nanalytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive)\nerror is guaranteed at level $\\alpha$. (ii) For the long tail of small\nintersectional groups, we derive a fully Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial\nestimator; Monte-Carlo credible intervals are calibrated for any sample size\nand naturally converge to Wald intervals as more data becomes available. We\nvalidate our approach empirically on benchmark datasets, demonstrating how our\ntests provide interpretable, statistically rigorous decisions under varying\ndegrees of data availability and intersectionality."}

Our main results show that for AI systems\nwith expressiveness EXP$(m)$ above a critical threshold $\\tau$, safety\nverification requires exponential time and is coNP-complete. We formalize the\nCapability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic, which demonstrates how increasing AI\ncapability drives societal safety requirements toward perfection, creating an\ninescapable tension with verification complexity. Through four core theorems,\nwe prove that (1) verification complexity grows exponentially with system\nexpressiveness, (2) safe policies comprise at most a $2^{-2^m}$ fraction of the\npolicy space, (3) no finite set of alignment techniques can provide universal\ncoverage, and (4) robust safety properties form measure-zero sets for neural\nnetworks. These results characterize an \"intractability gap\" where practical\nsafety requirements fall within the region of computational intractability. We\nconclude by presenting a strategic trilemma: AI development must either\nconstrain system complexity to maintain verifiable safety, accept unverifiable\nrisks while scaling capabilities, or develop fundamentally new safety paradigms\nbeyond verification. Our work provides the first systematic\ncomplexity-theoretic analysis of AI alignment and establishes rigorous bounds\nthat any safety approach must confront. A formal verification of the core\ntheorems in Lean4 is currently in progress."}

Pok\\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC) is a domain with an\nextraordinarily large space of possible team configurations of approximately\n$10^{139}$ - far larger than those of Dota or Starcraft. The highly discrete,\ncombinatorial nature of team building in Pok\\'emon VGC causes optimal\nstrategies to shift dramatically depending on both the team being piloted and\nthe opponent's team, making generalization uniquely challenging. To advance\nresearch on this problem, we introduce VGC-Bench: a benchmark that provides\ncritical infrastructure, standardizes evaluation protocols, and supplies\nhuman-play datasets and a range of baselines - from large-language-model agents\nand behavior cloning to reinforcement learning and empirical game-theoretic\nmethods such as self-play, fictitious play, and double oracle. In the\nrestricted setting where an agent is trained and evaluated on a single-team\nconfiguration, our methods are able to win against a professional VGC\ncompetitor. We extensively evaluated all baseline methods over progressively\nlarger team sets and find that even the best-performing algorithm in the\nsingle-team setting struggles at scaling up as team size grows. Thus, policy\ngeneralization across diverse team strategies remains an open challenge for the\ncommunity. Our code is open sourced at\nhttps://github.com/cameronangliss/VGC-Bench."}

Our\nmethod combines a neural network-based symptom generator, which employs\nsubsystem-level anomaly detection, with a new graph diagnosis algorithm that\nleverages minimal causal relationship information between\nsubsystems-information that is typically available in practice.
