Bochkov"], "title": "Growing Transformers: Modular Composition and Layer-wise Expansion on a Frozen Substrate", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves\nmonolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks\nflexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model\ndevelopment, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input\nembeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can\nemerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual\nstructure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed\nrepresentational substrate acts as a universal \"docking port,\" enabling two\npowerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and\nprogressive layer-wise growth.\n  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,\nRussian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural\nmodification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The\nresulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning\nbenchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic\nforgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training\nmethodology, where a deep Transformer is \"grown\" by progressively stacking and\ntraining one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a\nclear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning\nabilities, such as those required for SQuAD.\n  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a\nmore biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is\nbuilt incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues\nfor resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized\necosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to\nfacilitate further research."}

An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion\ndatasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of\nmanual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce\nFACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It\nleverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline\npowered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and\ndetailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2,\nwhich fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight\nadapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for\nfine-grained fashion-specific information.

Over the next 200\nyears, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to\nexperiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.\nAround 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for\norchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were\nthen reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on\nseveral characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.\nlines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced\ninstruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by\nexperts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or\nnon-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments\nwhose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each\ninstrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.\nEach line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y\n= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)\nand how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional\nfeatures from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values\nfall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of\nlevels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.\n  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can\npredict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non\nreduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a\nwhole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more\ndifficult to quantify the reduction.

While these techniques already establish\nthat data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on\nhigh-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and\ndesigned prompts.\n  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes\nlittle to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly,\nbenign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This\nhighlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed\nuser and unintentionally.

While compatible with low-power\nmicrocontrollers (MCUs), structured pruning underutilizes the opportunity for\nfine-grained efficiency on devices without SIMD support or parallel compute. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce UnIT (Unstructured Inference-Time\npruning), a lightweight method that dynamically identifies and skips\nunnecessary multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations during inference, guided by\ninput-specific activation patterns. Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces\nirregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization.\nIt transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing\nmultiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions. UnIT further\noptimizes compute by reusing threshold computations across multiple connections\nand applying layer- and group-specific pruning sensitivity. We present three\nfast, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored to the capabilities of\ncommon embedded platforms. Demonstrated on the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT\nachieves 11.02% to 82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30% to 84.19% faster inference, and\n27.33% to 84.38% lower energy consumption compared to training-time pruned\nmodels, while maintaining accuracy with 0.48-7%. Under domain shift, UnIT\nmatches or exceeds the accuracy of retrained models while requiring\nsignificantly fewer MACs. These results establish unstructured inference-time\npruning as a viable and practical solution for efficient, retraining-free\ndeployment of deep neural networks on MCUs."}
