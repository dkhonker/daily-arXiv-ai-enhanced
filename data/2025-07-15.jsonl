However, we observe that these reasoning paths tend to include\nsubstantial redundancy; analyzing attention patterns reveals that attention\nscores are widely scattered, particularly incorrect answers exhibit greater\nattention sparsity. In this paper, we demonstrate that deliberately removing\nthis redundancy in the reasoning process significantly improves performance\nthrough clear thinking, i.e., removing distraction. Specifically, we\nsystematically identify reasoning redundancy by measuring token-level attention\nscores to a special end-of-thinking token, which is appended to an explicit\ninstruction inserted to conclude each intermediate reasoning step. Furthermore,\nwe propose structure-aware pruning that prioritizes removing tokens in\nlow-contributing reasoning chunks over individual tokens. After evicting\nredundant tokens, we remove the injected end-of-thinking instruction, then\nresume the reasoning generation. We demonstrate that our method significantly\nimproves overall accuracy across reasoning-intensive benchmarks without any\ntraining involved. In particular, our method shows strong performance on\nchallenging mathematical competition benchmarks such as AIME and AMC, where\nreasoning redundancy is more prevalent."}

However, due to characteristics like omnidirectional exposure\nand the broadcast nature of the BA phase, it is particularly vulnerable to\neavesdropping and identity impersonation attacks. To this end, this paper\nproposes a novel secure framework named CovertAuth, designed to enhance the\nsecurity of the BA phase against such attacks. In particular, to combat\neavesdropping attacks, the closed-form expressions of successful BA probability\nand covert transmission rate are first derived. Then, a covert communication\nproblem aimed at jointly optimizing beam training budget and transmission power\nis formulated to maximize covert communication rate, subject to the covertness\nrequirement. An alternating optimization algorithm combined with successive\nconvex approximation is employed to iteratively achieve optimal results. To\ncombat impersonation attacks, the mutual coupling effect of antenna array\nimpairments is explored as a device feature to design a weighted-sum energy\ndetector based physical layer authentication scheme. Moreover, theoretical\nmodels for authentication metrics like detection and false alarm probabilities\nare also provided to conduct performance analysis. Based on these models, an\noptimization problem is constructed to determine the optimal weight value that\nmaximizes authentication accuracy.

Our key insight is that parallel hybrid approaches eliminate the\nmultiplicative latency penalties inherent in sequential methods mandated by RFC\n9370, achieving significant performance improvements under realistic network\nconditions. Performance evaluation using a Docker-based testing framework with\nIDQuantique QKD hardware demonstrates that the parallel hybrid approach\nsignificantly outperforms sequential methods under network latency conditions,\nwhile pure QKD achieves minimal bandwidth overhead through identifier-based key\ncoordination. Our implementations provide practical quantum-enhanced IPsec\nsolutions suitable for critical infrastructure deployments requiring\ndefense-in-depth security."}

Our approach combines several algorithmic\ninnovations including adaptive network architectures, causal training, and\nadvanced optimization methods to overcome the inherent challenges of learning\nchaotic dynamics. Through rigorous validation on challenging turbulence\nproblems, we demonstrate that PINNs accurately reproduce key flow statistics\nincluding energy spectra, kinetic energy, enstrophy, and Reynolds stresses. Our\nresults demonstrate that neural equation solvers can handle complex chaotic\nsystems, opening new possibilities for continuous turbulence modeling that\ntranscends traditional computational limitations."}

To address this, we leverage boundary adversarial attack\ntechniques, revealing two key observations. First, poison samples exhibit\nsignificantly greater distances from decision boundaries compared to clean\nsamples, indicating they require larger adversarial perturbations to change\ntheir predictions. Second, while adversarial predicted labels for clean samples\nare uniformly distributed, those for poison samples tend to revert to their\noriginal correct labels.

However, LBD and AD data are typically collected from different sites\nusing different machines and protocols, resulting in a distinct domain shift.\nTo effectively leverage AD data while mitigating domain shift, we propose a\nTransferability Aware Transformer (TAT) that adapts knowledge from AD to\nenhance LBD diagnosis. Our method utilizes structural connectivity (SC) derived\nfrom structural MRI as training data. Built on the attention mechanism, TAT\nadaptively assigns greater weights to disease-transferable features while\nsuppressing domain-specific ones, thereby reducing domain shift and improving\ndiagnostic accuracy with limited LBD data. The experimental results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of TAT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study\nto explore domain adaptation from AD to LBD under conditions of data scarcity\nand domain shift, providing a promising framework for domain-adaptive diagnosis\nof rare diseases."}

Although existing methods attempt to employ\nvarious compression techniques to reduce communication overhead, due to the\nparameter errors introduced by model compression, they inevitably suffer from\nmodel performance degradation. To simultaneously address the above problems,\nthis paper presents a communication-efficient FedRec framework named FedRAS,\nwhich adopts an action-sharing strategy to cluster the gradients of item\nembedding into a specific number of model updating actions for communication\nrather than directly compressing the item embeddings. In this way, the cloud\nserver can use the limited actions from clients to update all the items. Since\ngradient values are significantly smaller than item embeddings, constraining\nthe directions of gradients (i.e., the action space) introduces smaller errors\ncompared to compressing the entire item embedding matrix into a reduced space.\nTo accommodate heterogeneous devices and network environments, FedRAS\nincorporates an adaptive clustering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the\nnumber of actions.

The vast majority of\nTD methods for control learn a policy by bootstrapping from a single\naction-value function (e.g., Q-learning and Sarsa). Significantly less\nattention has been given to methods that bootstrap from two asymmetric value\nfunctions: i.e., methods that learn state values as an intermediate step in\nlearning action values. Existing algorithms in this vein can be categorized as\neither QV-learning or AV-learning. Though these algorithms have been\ninvestigated to some degree in prior work, it remains unclear if and when it is\nadvantageous to learn two value functions instead of just one -- and whether\nsuch approaches are theoretically sound in general. In this paper, we analyze\nthese algorithmic families in terms of convergence and sample efficiency. We\nfind that while both families are more efficient than Expected Sarsa in the\nprediction setting, only AV-learning methods offer any major benefit over\nQ-learning in the control setting.

This paper\npresents an unsupervised framework that automatically detects, clusters, and\nprioritizes security events discussed across hacker forum posts. Our approach\nleverages Transformer-based embeddings fine-tuned with contrastive learning to\ngroup related discussions into distinct security event clusters, identifying\nincidents like zero-day disclosures or malware releases without relying on\npredefined keywords. The framework incorporates a daily ranking mechanism that\nprioritizes identified events using quantifiable metrics reflecting timeliness,\nsource credibility, information completeness, and relevance. Experimental\nevaluation on real-world hacker forum data demonstrates that our method\neffectively reduces noise and surfaces high-priority threats, enabling security\nanalysts to mount proactive responses. By transforming disparate hacker forum\ndiscussions into structured, actionable intelligence, our work addresses\nfundamental challenges in automated threat detection and analysis."}

To resolve this issue, we propose a novel framework that\nintegrates HE with advanced neural networks to secure facial data throughout\nthe inference phase. This method ensures that facial data remains secure with\nminimal impact on detection accuracy. Specifically, the proposed system\nleverages the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme to perform computations directly\non encrypted data, optimizing computational efficiency and security.\nFurthermore, we develop an effective data encoding method specifically designed\nto preprocess the raw facial data into CKKS form in a\nSingle-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) manner.

Hence, a large\namount of effort is put into designing and searching for large collection of\nevaluation tasks that can serve as a proxy of our grand goal. We argue that\nsuch a rigid evaluation protocol creates a silent bottleneck in AI research. To\nremedy that, we define a probabilistic space of downstream tasks obtained by\nadopting a distribution of tasks and by defining Task Priors. Under this view,\none can evaluate a model's performance over the set of all possible downstream\ntasks. Our framework is the first to provide answers to key questions such as\n(i) what is the average performance of my model over all possible downstream\ntasks weighted by the probability to encounter each task? or (ii) what is the\nvariance of my model's performance across all downstream tasks under the\ndefined Task Priors?

To tackle this challenge,\nwe propose a stable and efficient Feature Distillation for model-heterogeneous\nFederated learning, dubbed FedFD, that can incorporate aligned feature\ninformation via orthogonal projection to integrate knowledge from heterogeneous\nmodels better. Specifically, a new feature-based ensemble federated knowledge\ndistillation paradigm is proposed. The global model on the server needs to\nmaintain a projection layer for each client-side model architecture to align\nthe features separately. Orthogonal techniques are employed to re-parameterize\nthe projection layer to mitigate knowledge bias from heterogeneous models and\nthus maximize the distilled knowledge. Extensive experiments show that FedFD\nachieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

We highlight an underexploited opportunity: LLM routing\ndata, produced when hosting platforms route diverse queries to different\nmodels, which can reveal comparative strengths across tasks. To address this,\nwe propose FusionBench, a comprehensive routing benchmark covering 14 tasks\nacross five domains with 20 open-source LLMs (8B to 671B parameters), capturing\n103M tokens and summarizing reusable thought templates from top models.\nBuilding on this, we introduce FusionFactory, a systematic fusion framework\nwith three levels: (1) query-level fusion, tailoring routers for each query\nusing both direct responses and reasoning-augmented outputs; (2) thought-level\nfusion, leveraging abstract templates derived from top-performing LLMs' answers\nto similar queries; and (3) model-level fusion, transferring capabilities\nbetween models via distillation, using top responses or highest judge scores as\ntraining data. Experiments show FusionFactory consistently outperforms the best\nindividual LLM across all 14 benchmarks, with optimal fusion configurations\nvarying by benchmark, demonstrating the value of systematic LLM fusion in\nharnessing complementary strengths and improving overall performance."}

However, their performance is degraded by the\nthresholding of the post-training symbolic translation process. We show here\nthat part of the performance degradation during translation is due to its\nfailure to disentangle the learned knowledge represented in the form of the\nnetworks' weights. We address this issue by proposing a new disentanglement\nmethod; by splitting nodes that encode nested rules into smaller independent\nnodes, we are able to better preserve the models' performance. Through\nexperiments on binary, multiclass, and multilabel classification tasks\n(including those requiring predicate invention), we demonstrate that our\ndisentanglement method provides compact and interpretable logical\nrepresentations for the neural DNF-based models, with performance closer to\nthat of their pre-translation counterparts.

However, we observe that these reasoning paths tend to include\nsubstantial redundancy; analyzing attention patterns reveals that attention\nscores are widely scattered, particularly incorrect answers exhibit greater\nattention sparsity. In this paper, we demonstrate that deliberately removing\nthis redundancy in the reasoning process significantly improves performance\nthrough clear thinking, i.e., removing distraction. Specifically, we\nsystematically identify reasoning redundancy by measuring token-level attention\nscores to a special end-of-thinking token, which is appended to an explicit\ninstruction inserted to conclude each intermediate reasoning step. Furthermore,\nwe propose structure-aware pruning that prioritizes removing tokens in\nlow-contributing reasoning chunks over individual tokens. After evicting\nredundant tokens, we remove the injected end-of-thinking instruction, then\nresume the reasoning generation. We demonstrate that our method significantly\nimproves overall accuracy across reasoning-intensive benchmarks without any\ntraining involved. In particular, our method shows strong performance on\nchallenging mathematical competition benchmarks such as AIME and AMC, where\nreasoning redundancy is more prevalent."}

However, its deployment in real-world multi-agent systems (MAS)\nremains limited, primarily due to the complex and dynamic nature of such\nenvironments. These challenges arise from multiple interacting sources of\nvariability, including fluctuating agent populations, evolving task goals, and\ninconsistent execution conditions. Together, these factors demand that MARL\nalgorithms remain effective under continuously changing system configurations\nand operational demands. To better capture and assess this capacity for\nadjustment, we introduce the concept of \\textit{adaptability} as a unified and\npractically grounded lens through which to evaluate the reliability of MARL\nalgorithms under shifting conditions, broadly referring to any changes in the\nenvironment dynamics that may occur during learning or execution. Centred on\nthe notion of adaptability, we propose a structured framework comprising three\nkey dimensions: learning adaptability, policy adaptability, and scenario-driven\nadaptability.

Among these,\nDecision Transformer (DT) has gained particular attention in the context of\noffline reinforcement learning due to its ability to frame return-conditioned\npolicy learning as a sequence modeling task. Most recently, Bhargava et al.\n(2024) provided a systematic comparison of DT with more conventional MLP-based\noffline RL algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC) and Conservative\nQ-Learning (CQL), and claimed that DT exhibits superior performance in\nsparse-reward and low-quality data settings.\n  In this paper, through experimentation on robotic manipulation tasks\n(Robomimic) and locomotion benchmarks (D4RL), we show that MLP-based Filtered\nBehavior Cloning (FBC) achieves competitive or superior performance compared to\nDT in sparse-reward environments. FBC simply filters out low-performing\ntrajectories from the dataset and then performs ordinary behavior cloning on\nthe filtered dataset. FBC is not only very straightforward, but it also\nrequires less training data and is computationally more efficient. The results\ntherefore suggest that DT is not preferable for sparse-reward environments.\nFrom prior work, arguably, DT is also not preferable for dense-reward\nenvironments. Thus, we pose the question: Is DT ever preferable?"}
