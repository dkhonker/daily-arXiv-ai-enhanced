In this work, we propose a novel mixed-precision quantization method\nfor KV Cache named KVmix. KVmix leverages gradient-based importance analysis to\nevaluate how individual Key and Value projection matrices affect the model\nloss, enabling layer-specific bit-width allocation for mix-precision\nquantization. It dynamically prioritizes higher precision for important layers\nwhile aggressively quantizing less influential ones, achieving a tunable\nbalance between accuracy and efficiency. KVmix also introduces a dynamic\nlong-context optimization strategy that adaptively keeps full-precision KV\npairs for recent pivotal tokens and compresses older ones, achieving\nhigh-quality sequence generation with low memory usage. Additionally, KVmix\nprovides efficient low-bit quantization and CUDA kernels to optimize\ncomputational overhead.

This\nprocedure involves performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a\ndomain-appropriate feature extractor, followed by training a traditional\npredictor on the resulting SFT embeddings. When used in this manner,\ntraditional predictors often deliver increased performance over the SFT model\nitself, despite the fine-tuned feature extractor yielding embeddings\nspecifically optimized for prediction by the neural network's final dense\nlayer. This suggests that directly incorporating traditional algorithms into\nSFT as prediction layers may further improve performance. However, many\ntraditional algorithms have not been implemented as neural network layers due\nto their non-differentiable nature and their unique optimization requirements.\nAs a step towards solving this problem, we introduce the Nearness of Neighbors\nAttention (NONA) regression layer. NONA uses the mechanics of neural network\nattention and a novel learned attention-masking scheme to yield a\ndifferentiable proxy of the k-NN regression algorithm. Results on multiple\nunstructured datasets show improved performance over both dense layer\nprediction and k-NN on SFT embeddings for regression."}

To elaborate,\nseveral studies have introduced a type of attacks known as gradient leakage\nattacks (GLAs), which exploit the gradients shared during training to\nreconstruct clients' raw data. On the flip side, some literature, however,\ncontends no substantial privacy risk in practical FL environments due to the\neffectiveness of such GLAs being limited to overly relaxed conditions, such as\nsmall batch sizes and knowledge of clients' data distributions.\n  This paper bridges this critical gap by empirically demonstrating that\nclients' data can still be effectively reconstructed, even within realistic FL\nenvironments.

Recent advances in generative AI have provided new tools for\nmodeling highly complex distributions. In this paper, we build a probabilistic\nmodel to predict which states an agent will visit in the temporally distant\nfuture (i.e., an occupancy measure) using flow matching. As large datasets are\noften constructed by many distinct users performing distinct tasks, we include\nin our model a latent variable capturing the user intention. This intention\nincreases the expressivity of our model, and enables adaptation with\ngeneralized policy improvement. We call our proposed method\nintention-conditioned flow occupancy models (InFOM). Comparing with alternative\nmethods for pre-training, our experiments on $36$ state-based and $4$\nimage-based benchmark tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves $1.8\n\\times$ median improvement in returns and increases success rates by $36\\%$.\nWebsite: https://chongyi-zheng.github.io/infom Code:\nhttps://github.com/chongyi-zheng/infom"}

Equation learning (EQL) methods can derive\ncontinuum models from ABM data, but they typically require extensive\nsimulations for each parameter set, raising concerns about generalizability. In\nthis work, we extend EQL to Multi-experiment equation learning (ME-EQL) by\nintroducing two methods: one-at-a-time ME-EQL (OAT ME-EQL), which learns\nindividual models for each parameter set and connects them via interpolation,\nand embedded structure ME-EQL (ES ME-EQL), which builds a unified model library\nacross parameters. We demonstrate these methods using a birth--death mean-field\nmodel and an on-lattice agent-based model of birth, death, and migration with\nspatial structure. Our results show that both methods significantly reduce the\nrelative error in recovering parameters from agent-based simulations, with OAT\nME-EQL offering better generalizability across parameter space.

This has motivated the development of popular local\n(i.e. sample-specific) feature importance (LFI) methods such as LIME and\nTreeSHAP. However, these approaches rely on approximations that ignore the\nmodel's internal structure and instead depend on potentially unstable\nperturbations.
