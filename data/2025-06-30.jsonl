To improve the automation of these bidding\nsystems, we adopt generative models, namely the Decision Transformer (DT), to\ntackle the difficulties inherent in automated bidding. Applying the Decision\nTransformer to the auto-bidding task enables a unified approach to sequential\nmodeling, which efficiently overcomes short-sightedness by capturing long-term\ndependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior. Nevertheless,\nconventional DT has certain drawbacks: (1) DT necessitates a preset\nreturn-to-go (RTG) value before generating actions, which is not inherently\nproduced; (2) The policy learned by DT is restricted by its training data,\nwhich is consists of mixed-quality trajectories. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step\nprocess: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on\nstate and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the\ntraining set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training\nset) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the\ncurrent state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT,\nwe generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator)\nto augment our training dataset. This data enhancement has been shown to\nimprove the RTG of trajectories in the training data and gradually leads the\nsuboptimal policy towards optimality.

Our work investigates how the\nKL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric\nPolicy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled\nresponses into positive and negative groups.

With the arisen of Continual Learning (CL), Continual\nReinforcement Learning (CRL) has emerged as a promising research direction to\naddress these limitations by enabling agents to learn continuously, adapt to\nnew tasks, and retain previously acquired knowledge. In this survey, we provide\na comprehensive examination of CRL, focusing on its core concepts, challenges,\nand methodologies. Firstly, we conduct a detailed review of existing works,\norganizing and analyzing their metrics, tasks, benchmarks, and scenario\nsettings. Secondly, we propose a new taxonomy of CRL methods, categorizing them\ninto four types from the perspective of knowledge storage and/or transfer.\nFinally, our analysis highlights the unique challenges of CRL and provides\npractical insights into future directions."}

First, we show that this\nparameter is not even identifiable in certain watermarking schemes, let alone\nconsistently estimable. In stark contrast, for watermarking methods that employ\ncontinuous pivotal statistics for detection, we demonstrate that the proportion\nparameter is identifiable under mild conditions. We propose efficient\nestimators for this class of methods, which include several popular unbiased\nwatermarks as examples, and derive minimax lower bounds for any measurable\nestimator based on pivotal statistics, showing that our estimators achieve\nthese lower bounds. Through evaluations on both synthetic data and mixed-source\ntext generated by open-source models, we demonstrate that our proposed\nestimators consistently achieve high estimation accuracy."}

A critical capability toward this endeavor is\nthe ability to reproduce existing work. To evaluate the ability of AI agents to\nreproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM\nSpeedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the\nNanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time.\nEach of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records\ntraining script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from\npseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records\nexecute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse\ncode-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to\nhardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible\nand realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that\nrecent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement\nalready-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints. Our\nbenchmark thus provides a simple, non-saturated measure of an LLMs ability to\nautomate scientific reproduction, a necessary (but not sufficient) skill for an\nautonomous research agent."}

In particular, while the\nneural tangent kernel (NTK) and neural network Gaussian process kernel (NNGP)\nhave given theoreticians tractable limiting cases of fully connected neural\nnetworks, their properties for most activation functions except for powers of\nthe ReLU function are poorly understood. Our main contribution is to provide a\nmore general characterization of the RKHS of these kernels for typical\nactivation functions whose only non-smoothness is at zero, such as SELU, ELU,\nor LeakyReLU. Our analysis also covers a broad set of special cases such as\nmissing biases, two-layer networks, or polynomial activations. Our results show\nthat a broad class of not infinitely smooth activations generate equivalent\nRKHSs at different network depths, while polynomial activations generate\nnon-equivalent RKHSs. Finally, we derive results for the smoothness of NNGP\nsample paths, characterizing the smoothness of infinitely wide neural networks\nat initialization."}
