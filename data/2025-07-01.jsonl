Among various methods for imputing missing spatiotemporal traffic data,\nthe latent factorization of tensors (LFT) model has emerged as a widely adopted\nand effective solution. However, conventional LFT models typically employ the\nstandard L2-norm in their learning objective, which makes them vulnerable to\nthe influence of outliers. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a\nthreshold distance weighted (TDW) loss-incorporated Latent Factorization of\nTensors (TDWLFT) model. The proposed loss function effectively reduces the\nmodel's sensitivity to outliers by assigning differentiated weights to\nindividual samples. Extensive experiments conducted on two traffic speed\ndatasets sourced from diverse urban environments confirm that the proposed\nTDWLFT model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of\nboth in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency."}

In covariate shift, estimating an\nunknown function's moment is a classical problem that remains under-explored,\ndespite its common occurrence in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the minimax lower bound of the problem when the source and target\ndistributions are known. To achieve the minimax optimal bound (up to a\nlogarithmic factor), we propose a two-stage algorithm. Specifically, it first\ntrains an optimal estimator for the function under the source distribution, and\nthen uses a likelihood ratio reweighting procedure to calibrate the moment\nestimator. In practice, the source and target distributions are typically\nunknown, and estimating the likelihood ratio may be unstable.

To address this, this paper introduces a\nfeature-wise mixing framework to mitigate contextual bias. This was done by\nredistributing feature representations across multiple contextual datasets. To\nassess feature-wise mixing's effectiveness, four ML classifiers were trained\nusing cross-validation and evaluated with bias-sensitive loss functions,\nincluding disparity metrics and mean squared error (MSE), which served as a\nstandard measure of predictive performance.

In PDE learning,\nadding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable\naccuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss. For linear PDEs we fully\ncharacterize this tradeoff with an explicit error decomposition and navigate it\nduring training with spectral derivatives and preconditioning. Across five\nbenchmark PDEs, adding a BWLer on top of an MLP improves RMSE by up to 30x for\nconvection, 10x for reaction, and 1800x for wave equations while remaining\ncompatible with first-order optimizers.

Building on this representation, we introduce a\n\\textbf{Causality-Seeking Agent} whose objectives are to (1) identify the meta\nstates that trigger each subgraph, (2) discover the corresponding causal\nrelationships by agent curiosity-driven intervention policy, and (3)\niteratively refine the Meta-Causal Graph through ongoing curiosity-driven\nexploration and agent experiences. Experiments on both synthetic tasks and a\nchallenging robot arm manipulation task demonstrate that our method robustly\ncaptures shifts in causal dynamics and generalizes effectively to previously\nunseen contexts."}

This paper makes three key contributions: first, we rigorously\ncharacterize why standard ANM approaches break down in the presence of\nunmeasured mediators. Second, we demonstrate that prior solutions for hidden\nmediation are brittle in finite sample settings, limiting their practical\nutility. To address these gaps, we propose Bivariate Denoising Diffusion (BiDD)\nfor causal discovery, a method designed to handle latent noise introduced by\nunmeasured mediators. Unlike prior methods that infer directionality through\nmean squared error loss comparisons, our approach introduces a novel\nindependence test statistic: during the noising and denoising processes for\neach variable, we condition on the other variable as input and evaluate the\nindependence of the predicted noise relative to this input. We prove asymptotic\nconsistency of BiDD under the ANM, and conjecture that it performs well under\nhidden mediation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate\nconsistent performance, outperforming existing methods in mediator-corrupted\nsettings while maintaining strong performance in mediator-free settings."}

However, these approaches often lack\ngeneralizability, adaptability and tend to be overly conservative, resulting in\nineffective repairs that not only fail to mitigate safety risks sufficiently\nbut also degrade the overall driving experience. To address this issue, we\npropose Adaptive Decision Repair (ADReFT), a novel and effective repair method\nthat identifies safety-critical states through offline learning from failed\ntests and generates appropriate mitigation actions to improve ADS safety.\nSpecifically, ADReFT incorporates a transformer-based model with two joint\nheads, State Monitor and Decision Adapter, designed to capture complex driving\nenvironment interactions to evaluate state safety severity and generate\nadaptive repair actions. Given the absence of oracles for state safety\nidentification, we first pretrain ADReFT using supervised learning with coarse\nannotations, i.e., labeling states preceding violations as positive samples and\nothers as negative samples. It establishes ADReFT's foundational capability to\nmitigate safety-critical violations, though it may result in somewhat\nconservative mitigation strategies. Therefore, we subsequently finetune ADReFT\nusing reinforcement learning to improve its initial capability and generate\nmore precise and contextually appropriate repair decisions.

To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose Coordination Transformers (CooT), a novel in-context\ncoordination framework that uses recent interaction histories to adapt to\nunseen partners rapidly. Unlike previous approaches that primarily aim to\nincrease the diversity of training partners, CooT explicitly focuses on\nadapting to new partner behaviors by predicting actions aligned with observed\npartner interactions. Trained on interaction trajectories collected from\ndiverse pairs of agents with complementary behaviors, CooT quickly learns\neffective coordination strategies without explicit supervision or fine-tuning.\nEvaluations on the Overcooked benchmark demonstrate that CooT significantly\noutperforms baseline methods in coordination tasks involving previously unseen\npartners. Human evaluations further confirm CooT as the most effective\ncollaborative partner, while extensive ablations highlight its robustness,\nflexibility, and sensitivity to context in multi-agent scenarios."}

When solving a conjunction of word\nequations in this way, the performance of the solver will depend considerably\non the order in which equations are processed. In this work, the use of Graph\nNeural Networks (GNNs) for ranking word equations before and during the solving\nprocess is explored. For this, a novel graph-based representation for word\nequations is presented, preserving global information across conjuncts,\nenabling the GNN to have a holistic view during ranking. To handle the variable\nnumber of conjuncts, three approaches to adapt a multi-classification task to\nthe problem of ranking equations are proposed. The training of the GNN is done\nwith the help of minimum unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) of word equations. The\nexperimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art string solvers,\nthe new framework solves more problems in benchmarks where each variable\nappears at most once in each equation."}

While solving MAPF optimally has been proven to\nbe NP-hard, scalable, and efficient, solvers are vital for real-world\napplications like logistics, search-and-rescue, etc. To this end, decentralized\nsuboptimal MAPF solvers that leverage machine learning have come on stage.\nBuilding on the success of the recently introduced MAPF-GPT, a pure imitation\nlearning solver, we introduce MAPF-GPT-DDG. This novel approach effectively\nfine-tunes the pre-trained MAPF model using centralized expert data. Leveraging\na novel delta-data generation mechanism, MAPF-GPT-DDG accelerates training\nwhile significantly improving performance at test time. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that MAPF-GPT-DDG surpasses all existing learning-based MAPF\nsolvers, including the original MAPF-GPT, regarding solution quality across\nmany testing scenarios. Remarkably, it can work with MAPF instances involving\nup to 1 million agents in a single environment, setting a new milestone for\nscalability in MAPF domains."}

Despite the major advances of AI systems in areas such as math\nand science, especially since the introduction of transformer architectures, it\nis well-documented that even the most advanced frontier systems regularly and\nconsistently falter on easily-solvable deductive reasoning tasks. Hence, these\nsystems are unfit to fulfill the dream of achieving artificial general\nintelligence capable of sound deductive reasoning. We argue that their unsound\nbehavior is a consequence of the statistical learning approach powering their\ndevelopment. To overcome this, we contend that to achieve reliable deductive\nreasoning in learning-based AI systems, researchers must fundamentally shift\nfrom optimizing for statistical performance against distributions on reasoning\nproblems and algorithmic tasks to embracing the more ambitious exact learning\nparadigm, which demands correctness on all inputs. We argue that exact learning\nis both essential and possible, and that this ambitious objective should guide\nalgorithm design."}

The problem is particularly\nchallenging when the number or types of multiple co-evolution of resilience\n(for example, randomly placed) are extremely chaos. Existing end-to-end deep\nlearning ordinarily do not generalize well to unseen full-feld reconstruction\nof spatiotemporal co-evolution structure, and predict resilience of network\ntopology, especially in multiple chaos data regimes typically seen in\nreal-world applications. To address this challenge, here we propose industrial\nbrain, a human-like autonomous cognitive decision-making and planning framework\nintegrating higher-order activity-driven neuro network and CT-OODA symbolic\nreasoning to autonomous plan resilience directly from observational data of\nglobal variable. The industrial brain not only understands and model structure\nof node activity dynamics and network co-evolution topology without simplifying\nassumptions, and reveal the underlying laws hidden behind complex networks, but\nalso enabling accurate resilience prediction, inference, and planning.\nExperimental results show that industrial brain significantly outperforms\nresilience prediction and planning methods, with an accurate improvement of up\nto 10.8\\% over GoT and OlaGPT framework and 11.03\\% over spectral dimension\nreduction.

We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework\nwhere models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously\nimproving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision.\nThrough self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively\nchallenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To\nenable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online,\nmulti-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose\nrole-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training.\nUsing SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that\ntransfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6%\nimprovement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000\nexpert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through\nthree cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation,\nand case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple\nNegotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct\nreasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model\n(DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These\nresults demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable\nreasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous\nreasoning development."}
