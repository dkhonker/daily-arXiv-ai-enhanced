**动机:** 大型语言模型在长篇推理中表现出色，但其推理路径存在大量冗余，导致注意力分散，特别是在错误答案中更为明显。

**方法:** 通过测量token级别的注意力分数到一个特殊结束思考标记来系统地识别推理冗余，并提出了一种结构感知剪枝方法，优先移除低贡献的推理块而非单个token。

**结果:** 该方法显著提高了多个推理密集型基准的整体准确性，尤其在数学竞赛基准（如AIME和AMC）上表现出色。

**结论:** 本研究表明，通过去除推理过程中的冗余可以提高大型语言模型的性能，而无需任何训练。

**原文摘要:** Recent large language models have shown promising capabilities in long-form
reasoning, following structured chains of thought before arriving at a final
answer. However, we observe that these reasoning paths tend to include
substantial redundancy; analyzing attention patterns reveals that attention
scores are widely scattered, particularly incorrect answers exhibit greater
attention sparsity. In this paper, we demonstrate that deliberately removing
this redundancy in the reasoning process significantly improves performance
through clear thinking, i.e., removing distraction. Specifically, we
systematically identify reasoning redundancy by measuring token-level attention
scores to a special end-of-thinking token, which is appended to an explicit
instruction inserted to conclude each intermediate reasoning step. Furthermore,
we propose structure-aware pruning that prioritizes removing tokens in
low-contributing reasoning chunks over individual tokens. After evicting
redundant tokens, we remove the injected end-of-thinking instruction, then
resume the reasoning generation. We demonstrate that our method significantly
improves overall accuracy across reasoning-intensive benchmarks without any
training involved. In particular, our method shows strong performance on
challenging mathematical competition benchmarks such as AIME and AMC, where
reasoning redundancy is more prevalent.

**动机:** 现有的多标准评估方法依赖假设并可能受主观判断影响，同时在实际应用中需要考虑定性和定量标准。然而，这些方法通常采用同质性假设，这可能显著影响评估结果。

**方法:** 该研究提出了一种新的MCA方法，它结合了两个基于线性规划的虚拟差距分析（VGA）模型。这种方法旨在解决现有评估方法中的挑战，并确保评估既全面又可靠。

**结果:** 通过两个详细的数值例子证明了所提方法的准确性和透明度。

**结论:** 新方法提高了评估的效率和公平性，为自动决策系统和决策支持系统的进步提供了强有力的支持。

**原文摘要:** Modern methods for multi-criteria assessment (MCA), such as Data Envelopment
Analysis (DEA), Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA), and Multiple Criteria
Decision-Making (MCDM), are utilized to appraise a collection of
Decision-Making Units (DMUs), also known as alternatives, based on several
criteria. These methodologies inherently rely on assumptions and can be
influenced by subjective judgment to effectively tackle the complex evaluation
challenges in various fields. In real-world scenarios, it is essential to
incorporate both quantitative and qualitative criteria as they consist of
cardinal and ordinal data. Despite the inherent variability in the criterion
values of different alternatives, the homogeneity assumption is often employed,
significantly affecting evaluations. To tackle these challenges and determine
the most appropriate alternative, we propose a novel MCA approach that combines
two Virtual Gap Analysis (VGA) models. The VGA framework, rooted in linear
programming, is pivotal in the MCA methodology. This approach improves
efficiency and fairness, ensuring that evaluations are both comprehensive and
dependable, thus offering a strong and adaptive solution. Two comprehensive
numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and transparency of our proposed
method. The goal is to encourage continued advancement and stimulate progress
in automated decision systems and decision support systems.
