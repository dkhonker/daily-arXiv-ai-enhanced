Together, these components improve sample efficiency,\nexploration robustness, and compatibility with resource-constrained\nneuromodulatory hardware. We evaluate SEA-DBS on a biologically realistic\nsimulation of Parkinsonian basal ganglia activity, demonstrating faster\nconvergence, stronger suppression of pathological beta-band power, and\nresilience to post-training FP16 quantization. Our results show that SEA-DBS\noffers a practical and effective RL-based aDBS framework for real-time,\nresource-constrained neuromodulation."}

One major limitation of most\nexisting Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL\nin nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully\nutilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,\nposing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To\nthis end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating\nMix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable\non-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix\nconsists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient\nwith an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)\nKL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and\nflexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from\nefficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our\nexperiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base\nmodels. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with\n0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B\nmodel) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math\nreasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and\nMATH500).

Recently, several studies\nhighlighted the impact of the geometry of training trajectories on the\ngeneralization error, both theoretically and empirically.

By extending an existing\nnotion of \\textit{hypothesis set stability}, to \\textit{trajectory stability},\nwe prove that the generalization error of trajectory-stable algorithms can be\nupper bounded in terms of (i) TDA quantities describing the complexity of the\ntrajectory of the optimizer in the parameter space, and (ii) the trajectory\nstability parameter of the algorithm. Through a series of experimental\nevaluations, we demonstrate that the TDA terms in the bound are of great\nimportance, especially as the number of training samples grows.

We prove a lower bound on the size of neural networks required for\nthe supervised PINN empirical risk to fall below the variance of noisy\nsupervision labels.

To address this issue, we\ncomprehensively consider causal structure learning methods under both\nhorizontal and vertical federated settings. We provide the identification\ntheories and methods for learning causal structure in the horizontal and\nvertical federal setting via higher-order cumulants. Specifically, we first\naggregate higher-order cumulant information from all participating clients to\nconstruct global cumulant estimates. These global estimates are then used for\nrecursive source identification, ultimately yielding a global causal strength\nmatrix. Our approach not only enables the reconstruction of causal graphs but\nalso facilitates the estimation of causal strength coefficients. Our algorithm\ndemonstrates superior performance in experiments conducted on both synthetic\ndata and real-world data."}

One major limitation of most\nexisting Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL\nin nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully\nutilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,\nposing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To\nthis end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating\nMix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable\non-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix\nconsists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient\nwith an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)\nKL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and\nflexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from\nefficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our\nexperiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base\nmodels. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with\n0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B\nmodel) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math\nreasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and\nMATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level\nperformance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of\nrollout data volume.

Experimental results using\nmultiple quantum simulation libraries show that Q-Detection effectively defends\nagainst label manipulation and backdoor attacks. The metrics demonstrate that\nQ-Detection consistently outperforms the baseline methods and is comparable to\nthe state-of-the-art. Theoretical analysis shows that Q-Detection is expected\nto achieve more than a 20% speedup using quantum computing power."}

We present the Prompt Declaration Language (PDL), a novel approach\nto prompt representation that tackles this fundamental complexity by bringing\nprompts to the forefront, enabling manual and automatic prompt tuning while\ncapturing the composition of LLM calls together with rule-based code and\nexternal tools. By abstracting away the plumbing for such compositions, PDL\naims at improving programmer productivity while providing a declarative\nrepresentation that is amenable to optimization. This paper demonstrates PDL's\nutility through a real-world case study of a compliance agent. Tuning the\nprompting pattern of this agent yielded up to 4x performance improvement\ncompared to using a canned agent and prompt pattern."}

However, the model owner\ndoes not want to reveal the weights, as they are considered trade secrets. To\nsolve this problem, researchers have turned to zero-knowledge proofs of ML\nmodel inference. These proofs convince the user that the ML model output is\ncorrect, without revealing the weights of the model to the user. Past work on\nthese provers can be placed into two categories. The first method compiles the\nML model into a low-level circuit, and proves the circuit using a ZK-SNARK. The\nsecond method uses custom cryptographic protocols designed only for a specific\nclass of models. Unfortunately, the first method is highly inefficient, making\nit impractical for the large models used today, and the second method does not\ngeneralize well, making it difficult to update in the rapidly changing field of\nmachine learning. To solve this, we propose ZKTorch, an open source end-to-end\nproving system that compiles ML models into base cryptographic operations\ncalled basic blocks, each proved using specialized protocols. ZKTorch is built\non top of a novel parallel extension to the Mira accumulation scheme, enabling\nsuccinct proofs with minimal accumulation overhead. These contributions allow\nZKTorch to achieve at least a $3\\times$ reduction in the proof size compared to\nspecialized protocols and up to a $6\\times$ speedup in proving time over a\ngeneral-purpose ZKML framework."}

To bridge this gap, we propose LoRAShield,\nthe first data-free editing framework for securing LoRA models against misuse.\nOur platform-driven approach dynamically edits and realigns LoRA's weight\nsubspace via adversarial optimization and semantic augmentation. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that LoRAShield achieves remarkable effectiveness,\nefficiency, and robustness in blocking malicious generations without\nsacrificing the functionality of the benign task. By shifting the defense to\nplatforms, LoRAShield enables secure, scalable sharing of personalized models,\na critical step toward trustworthy generative ecosystems."}
