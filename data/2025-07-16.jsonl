SAMEP implements a\ndistributed memory repository with vector-based semantic search, cryptographic\naccess controls (AES-256-GCM), and standardized APIs compatible with existing\nagent communication protocols (MCP, A2A). We demonstrate SAMEP's effectiveness\nacross diverse domains including multi-agent software development, healthcare\nAI with HIPAA compliance, and multi-modal processing pipelines.

Additionally, we introduce a novel\ncode translation benchmark that includes up-to-date source code, extensive test\ncases, and manually annotated ground-truth translations, enabling comprehensive\nfunctional and stylistic evaluations. Experiments on both our new benchmark and\nexisting datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves code\ntranslation performance.

Our protocol addresses three critical\nchallenges: (1) persistent context preservation across agent sessions, (2)\nsecure multi-agent collaboration with fine-grained access control, and (3)\nefficient semantic discovery of relevant historical context. SAMEP implements a\ndistributed memory repository with vector-based semantic search, cryptographic\naccess controls (AES-256-GCM), and standardized APIs compatible with existing\nagent communication protocols (MCP, A2A). We demonstrate SAMEP's effectiveness\nacross diverse domains including multi-agent software development, healthcare\nAI with HIPAA compliance, and multi-modal processing pipelines. Experimental\nresults show 73% reduction in redundant computations, 89% improvement in\ncontext relevance scores, and complete compliance with regulatory requirements\nincluding audit trail generation.

We propose an intermediate Intention Capture layer between user\nqueries and Workflow Generation, implementing the Opus Workflow Intention\nFramework, which consists of extracting Workflow Signals from user queries,\ninterpreting them into structured Workflow Intention objects, and generating\nWorkflows based on these Intentions. Our results show that this layer enables\nLLMs to produce logical and meaningful outputs that scale reliably as query\ncomplexity increases. On a synthetic benchmark of 1,000 multi-intent\nquery-Workflow(s) pairs, applying the Opus Prompt Intention Framework to\nWorkflow Generation yields consistent improvements in semantic Workflow\nsimilarity metrics. In this paper, we introduce the Opus Prompt Intention\nFramework by applying the concepts of Workflow Signal and Workflow Intention to\nLLM-driven Workflow Generation.

We propose a framework, inspired\nby open-ended evolutionary theory, to reconsider these three \"dogmas.\" We\nrevisit each assumption and address related concerns raised alongside them. To\nmake our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first\nestablish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains\nover an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational\nprocesses. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary\ninsights to enrich the \"adaptation-rather-than-search\" view of learning. We\nthen address the third dogma regarding the limits of the reward hypothesis,\nusing analogies from evolutionary fitness to illuminate the scalar reward vs.\nmulti-objective debate. After discussing practical implications for exploration\nin RL, we turn to the first--and arguably most fundamental--issue: the absence\nof a formal account of agency. We argue that unlike the other two problems, the\nevolutionary paradigm alone cannot resolve the agency question, though it\ngestures in a productive direction.

To overcome this challenge,\nwe propose Phy-SSM, a generalizable method that integrates partial physics\nknowledge into state space models (SSMs) for long-term dynamics forecasting in\ncomplex environments. Our motivation is that SSMs can effectively capture\nlong-range dependencies in sequential data and model continuous dynamical\nsystems, while the incorporation of physics knowledge improves generalization\nability. The key challenge lies in how to seamlessly incorporate partially\nknown physics into SSMs. To achieve this, we decompose partially known system\ndynamics into known and unknown state matrices, which are integrated into a\nPhy-SSM unit. To further enhance long-term prediction performance, we introduce\na physics state regularization term to make the estimated latent states align\nwith system dynamics. Besides, we theoretically analyze the uniqueness of the\nsolutions for our method.

Submitted to Medical Image Analysis", "summary": "Tractography algorithms leverage diffusion MRI to reconstruct the fibrous\narchitecture of the brain's white matter. Among machine learning approaches,\nreinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising framework for\ntractography, outperforming traditional methods in several key aspects.\nTractOracle-RL, a recent RL-based approach, reduces false positives by\nincorporating anatomical priors into the training process via a reward-based\nmechanism. In this paper, we investigate four extensions of the original\nTractOracle-RL framework by integrating recent advances in RL, and we evaluate\ntheir performance across five diverse diffusion MRI datasets. Results\ndemonstrate that combining an oracle with the RL framework consistently leads\nto robust and reliable tractography, regardless of the specific method or\ndataset used. We also introduce a novel RL training scheme called Iterative\nReward Training (IRT), inspired by the Reinforcement Learning from Human\nFeedback (RLHF) paradigm. Instead of relying on human input, IRT leverages\nbundle filtering methods to iteratively refine the oracle's guidance throughout\ntraining. Experimental results show that RL methods trained with oracle\nfeedback significantly outperform widely used tractography techniques in terms\nof accuracy and anatomical validity."}
