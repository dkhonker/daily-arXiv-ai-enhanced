To\naddress these limitations and provide a unifying framework, we propose\nSupervised Calibration (SC), a loss-minimization based framework which learns\nan optimal, per-class affine transformation of the LLM's predictive\nprobabilities in the logit space without requiring external data beyond the\ncontext. By using a more expressive functional class, SC not only subsumes many\nexisting calibration methods in ICL as special cases, but also enables the\nability to alter and even completely reverse the orientation of the LLM's\ndecision boundary. Furthermore, SC's loss-based nature facilitates the seamless\nintegration of two purpose-built regularization techniques: context-invariance\nand directional trust-region.

In\nthis work, we focus on the bimodal setting and interpret contrastive learning\nas the optimization of (parameterized) encoders that define conditional\nprobability distributions, for each modality conditioned on the other,\nconsistent with the available data. This provides a framework for multimodal\nalgorithms such as crossmodal retrieval, which identifies the mode of one of\nthese conditional distributions, and crossmodal classification, which is\nsimilar to retrieval but includes a fine-tuning step to make it task specific.\n  The framework we adopt also gives rise to crossmodal generative models.

We\nstudy these generalizations of the classical approach in the multivariate\nGaussian setting. In this context we view the latent space identification as a\nlow-rank matrix approximation problem.

However, the theoretically tractable models, e.g.,\nperceptrons, random features models and kernel machines, or multi-index models\nand committee machines with few neurons, remained simple compared to those used\nin applications. In this paper we help reducing the gap between practical\nnetworks and their theoretical understanding through a statistical physics\nanalysis of the supervised learning of a two-layer fully connected network with\ngeneric weight distribution and activation function, whose hidden layer is\nlarge but remains proportional to the inputs dimension. This makes it more\nrealistic than infinitely wide networks where no feature learning occurs, but\nalso more expressive than narrow ones or with fixed inner weights. We focus on\nthe Bayes-optimal learning in the teacher-student scenario, i.e., with a\ndataset generated by another network with the same architecture. We operate\naround interpolation, where the number of trainable parameters and of data are\ncomparable and feature learning emerges. Our analysis uncovers a rich\nphenomenology with various learning transitions as the number of data\nincreases. In particular, the more strongly the features (i.e., hidden neurons\nof the target) contribute to the observed responses, the less data is needed to\nlearn them. Moreover, when the data is scarce, the model only learns non-linear\ncombinations of the teacher weights, rather than \"specialising\" by aligning its\nweights with the teacher's. Specialisation occurs only when enough data becomes\navailable, but it can be hard to find for practical training algorithms,\npossibly due to statistical-to-computational~gaps."}

We introduce BIRD (Behavior Induction via\nRepresentation-structure Distillation), a flexible framework for transferring\naligned behavior by matching the internal representation structure of a student\nmodel to that of a teacher. Applied to out-of-distribution robustness in image\nclassification, BIRD outperforms fine-tuning, transfer learning, and continual\nlearning methods, improving robust accuracy by up to 16% over the next\nstrongest baseline.

In this work, we systematically investigate the\ndynamics between SFT and RL on eight reasoning tasks: Countdown, Sudoku, Arc\n1D, Geometry, Color Cube Rotation, List Functions, Zebra Puzzles, and Self\nReference. Our findings highlight that short CoT sequences used in SFT as a\nwarm-up do have moderate contribution to RL training, compared with cold-start\nRL; however such contribution diminishes when tasks become increasingly\ndifficult. Motivated by this observation, we construct synthetic datasets\nvarying systematically in the number of backtracking steps and conduct\ncontrolled experiments to isolate the influence of either the correctness\n(content) or the structure (i.e., backtrack frequency). We find that (1) longer\nCoT with backtracks generally induce better and more stable RL training, (2)\nmore challenging problems with larger search space tend to need higher numbers\nof backtracks during the SFT stage.

To navigate this tradeoff, McCandlish et al.\n(2018) suggest that a critical batch size (CBS), below which training will not\nsubstantially degrade loss, can be estimated based on the gradient noise scale\nduring training. While their method has been adopted in practice, e.g., when\ntraining GPT-3, strong assumptions are required to justify gradient noise as a\nproxy for the CBS, which makes it unclear whether their approach should be\ntrusted in practice, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we introduce a\nsimple, empirical approach to directly measure the CBS and show how the CBS\nevolves over training. Applying our approach to the OLMo models, we find that\nCBS is near 0 at initialization, increases rapidly at first, and then plateaus\nas training progresses. Furthermore, we find that this trend holds across\ndifferent model sizes (1B and 7B), suggesting CBS from small training runs can\ninform larger-scale training runs. Our findings about how the CBS changes over\ntraining motivate batch size warmup as a natural way to reliably train language\nmodels at large batch size: start the batch size small and increase it as the\nCBS grows. To validate this claim, we use batch size warmup to train OLMo 1B to\nslightly better loss than the original training run with 43% fewer gradient\nsteps. This shows how our framework can be applied to reliably train language\nmodels at larger batch sizes, increasing data parallelism without compromising\nperformance."}

Inspired by this\nfinding, we further propose a variant of SAM, coined as CSAM, to ameliorate\nmodel calibration. Extensive experiments on various datasets, including\nImageNet-1K, demonstrate the benefits of SAM in reducing calibration error.\nMeanwhile, CSAM performs even better than SAM and consistently achieves lower\ncalibration error than other approaches"}

Effective RL for LLMs\nrequires massive parallelization and poses an urgent need for efficient\ntraining systems. Most existing large-scale RL systems for LLMs are synchronous\nby alternating generation and training in a batch setting, where the rollouts\nin each training batch are generated by the same (or latest) model. This\nstabilizes RL training but suffers from severe system-level inefficiency.\nGeneration must wait until the longest output in the batch is completed before\nmodel update, resulting in GPU underutilization. We present AReaL, a\n\\emph{fully asynchronous} RL system that completely decouples generation from\ntraining. Rollout workers in AReaL continuously generate new outputs without\nwaiting, while training workers update the model whenever a batch of data is\ncollected. AReaL also incorporates a collection of system-level optimizations,\nleading to substantially higher GPU utilization. To stabilize RL training,\nAReaL balances the workload of rollout and training workers to control data\nstaleness, and adopts a staleness-enhanced PPO variant to better handle\noutdated training samples. Extensive experiments on math and code reasoning\nbenchmarks show that AReaL achieves \\textbf{up to 2.57$\\times$ training\nspeedup} compared to the best synchronous systems with the same number of GPUs\nand matched or even improved final performance.

For example, in the code optimization task, code\nLLMs excel at different optimization categories and no one dominates others.\nThis observation prompts the question of how one leverages multiple LLM agents\nto solve a coding problem without knowing their complementary strengths a\npriori. We argue that a team of agents can learn from each other's successes\nand failures so as to improve their own performance. Thus, a lesson is the\nknowledge produced by an agent and passed on to other agents in the collective\nsolution process. We propose a lesson-based collaboration framework, design the\nlesson solicitation--banking--selection mechanism, and demonstrate that a team\nof small LLMs with lessons learned can outperform a much larger LLM and other\nmulti-LLM collaboration methods."}
