To address these challenges, we\nintroduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse\nexperiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for\nautonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts,\nDreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model\nthat derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through\nstep-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To\nimprove the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an\nexperience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and\ncontinuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent\ntraining. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new\ntasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online\ncurriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent\nbackbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in\nfully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready\ntasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in\nRL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only\nsynthetic interactions.

In this work, we consider whether reasoning language models\nrepresent the alternate paths that they could take during generation. To test\nthis hypothesis, we use hidden activations to control and predict a language\nmodel's uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning. In our experiments, we\nfind a clear correlation between how uncertain a model is at different tokens,\nand how easily the model can be steered by controlling its activations. This\nsuggests that activation interventions are most effective when there are\nalternate paths available to the model -- in other words, when it has not yet\ncommitted to a particular final answer. We also find that hidden activations\ncan predict a model's future outcome distribution, demonstrating that models\nimplicitly represent the space of possible paths.", "AI": {"tldr": "研究发现语言模型的隐藏激活可以预测和控制其不确定性，表明模型在推理过程中隐式表示了可能的替代路径，激活干预在模型尚未确定最终答案时最有效。", "motivation": "语言模型在生成文本时，不同token的选择会导致不同的推理路径，这使得不确定性难以量化。研究旨在探索语言模型是否表示其生成过程中可能采取的替代路径。", "method": "使用隐藏激活来控制和预测语言模型在思维链推理过程中的不确定性，通过实验分析模型在不同token上的不确定性与激活控制效果之间的相关性。", "result": "发现模型在不同token上的不确定程度与其被激活控制的容易程度存在明显相关性，表明激活干预在模型有替代路径可用时最有效。隐藏激活还能预测模型的未来输出分布。", "conclusion": "语言模型隐式表示了可能的路径空间，激活干预可以作为理解和控制模型不确定性的有效工具，特别是在模型尚未确定最终答案的阶段。"}}
