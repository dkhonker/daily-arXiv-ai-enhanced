In particular, the prevalence of heavy-tailed spectral densities in\nJacobians, Hessians, and weight matrices has led to the introduction of the\nconcept of heavy-tailed mechanistic universality (HT-MU). Multiple lines of\nempirical evidence suggest a robust correlation between heavy-tailed metrics\nand model performance, indicating that HT-MU may be a fundamental aspect of\ndeep learning efficacy. Here, we propose a general family of random matrix\nmodels -- the high-temperature Marchenko-Pastur (HTMP) ensemble -- to explore\nattributes that give rise to heavy-tailed behavior in trained neural networks.\nUnder this model, spectral densities with power laws on (upper and lower) tails\narise through a combination of three independent factors (complex correlation\nstructures in the data; reduced temperatures during training; and reduced\neigenvector entropy), appearing as an implicit bias in the model structure, and\nthey can be controlled with an \"eigenvalue repulsion\" parameter. Implications\nof our model on other appearances of heavy tails, including neural scaling\nlaws, optimizer trajectories, and the five-plus-one phases of neural network\ntraining, are discussed."}

Although\nquantum computing has advanced rapidly in recent years, its relevance to social\ntheory remains underexplored. Most existing research focuses on micro-cognitive\nmodels or philosophical analogies, leaving a gap in system-level applications\nof quantum principles to the analysis of social systems. This study addresses\nthat gap by proposing a theoretical and computational framework that combines\nquantum mechanics with Generative AI to simulate the emergence and evolution of\nsocial norms. Drawing on core quantum concepts--such as superposition,\nentanglement, and probabilistic measurement--this research models society as a\ndynamic, uncertain system and sets up five ideal-type experiments. These\nscenarios are simulated using 25 generative agents, each assigned evolving\nroles as compliers, resistors, or enforcers. Within a simulated environment\nmonitored by a central observer (the Watcher), agents interact, respond to\nsurveillance, and adapt to periodic normative disruptions. These interactions\nallow the system to self-organize under external stress and reveal emergent\npatterns. Key findings show that quantum principles, when integrated with\ngenerative AI, enable the modeling of uncertainty, emergence, and\ninterdependence in complex social systems. Simulations reveal patterns\nincluding convergence toward normative order, the spread of resistance, and the\nspontaneous emergence of new equilibria in social rules. In conclusion, this\nstudy introduces a novel computational lens that lays the groundwork for a\nquantum-informed social theory. It offers interdisciplinary insights into how\nsociety can be understood not just as a structure to observe but as a dynamic\nsystem to simulate and redesign through quantum technologies."}

Our algorithm is motivated by existing\nworks that combine DM-based methods with the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)\nmethod.

However, the emergence of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) and foundation models has raised the question: Do we\nstill need continual learning when centralised, monolithic models can tackle\ndiverse tasks with access to internet-scale knowledge? We argue that continual\nlearning remains essential for three key reasons: (i) continual pre-training is\nstill necessary to ensure foundation models remain up to date, mitigating\nknowledge staleness and distribution shifts while integrating new information;\n(ii) continual fine-tuning enables models to specialise and personalise,\nadapting to domain-specific tasks, user preferences, and real-world constraints\nwithout full retraining, avoiding the need for computationally expensive long\ncontext-windows; (iii) continual compositionality offers a scalable and modular\napproach to intelligence, enabling the orchestration of foundation models and\nagents to be dynamically composed, recombined, and adapted.

This raises a\nnatural question: Does thinking more at test-time truly lead to better\nreasoning? To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study\nacross models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial\nperformance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to\n\"overthinking\". To understand this non-monotonic trend, we consider a simple\nprobabilistic model, which reveals that additional thinking increases output\nvariance-creating an illusion of improved reasoning while ultimately\nundermining precision. Thus, observed gains from \"more thinking\" are not true\nindicators of improved reasoning, but artifacts stemming from the connection\nbetween model uncertainty and evaluation metric.

These two\nmodels are therefore strongly related in a way that the behaviors of either\nmodel are considered to be an approximation of the behaviors of the other. In\nthis work, we establish a more formal relationship between these two models by\nbounding the approximation error between two such related models. The obtained\nerror bound then allows us to use one of the models as a verification proxy for\nthe other, without running the verification tools twice: if the reachable\noutput set expanded by the error bound satisfies a safety property on one of\nthe models, this safety property is then guaranteed to be also satisfied on the\nother model.

With the rise of deep learning, deep continual learning has\nprimarily focused on learning robust and reusable representations over time to\nsolve sequences of increasingly complex tasks. However, the emergence of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) and foundation models has raised the question: Do we\nstill need continual learning when centralised, monolithic models can tackle\ndiverse tasks with access to internet-scale knowledge? We argue that continual\nlearning remains essential for three key reasons: (i) continual pre-training is\nstill necessary to ensure foundation models remain up to date, mitigating\nknowledge staleness and distribution shifts while integrating new information;\n(ii) continual fine-tuning enables models to specialise and personalise,\nadapting to domain-specific tasks, user preferences, and real-world constraints\nwithout full retraining, avoiding the need for computationally expensive long\ncontext-windows; (iii) continual compositionality offers a scalable and modular\napproach to intelligence, enabling the orchestration of foundation models and\nagents to be dynamically composed, recombined, and adapted.

To address these challenges, task\nvector-based approaches compress task information into a single vector.\nHowever, these methods typically construct task vectors from fixed sets of\ndemonstrations and reuse them across input queries, without conditioning on the\nspecific input. This limitation can lead models to struggle with effective\nadaptation when the input query is not well aligned with the underlying\ndemonstrations, consequently degrading their generalization performance on\nunseen tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose Adaptive Task Vectors\n(ATV), a simple and effective framework that dynamically generates task vectors\nconditioned on each input query.

To\naddress this, we propose a Causality-guided Architecture Representation\nLearning (CARL) method aiming to separate critical (causal) and redundant\n(non-causal) features of architectures for generalizable architecture\nperformance prediction. Specifically, we employ a substructure extractor to\nsplit the input architecture into critical and redundant substructures in the\nlatent space. Then, we generate multiple interventional samples by pairing\ncritical representations with diverse redundant representations to prioritize\ncritical features. Extensive experiments on five NAS search spaces demonstrate\nthe state-of-the-art accuracy and superior interpretability of CARL. For\ninstance, CARL achieves 97.67% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 using DARTS."}

In\nthis paper, rather than examining multimodal RL in isolation, we delve into\ncurrent training pipelines and identify three crucial phenomena: 1) Effective\ncold start initialization is critical for enhancing MLLM reasoning.\nIntriguingly, we find that initializing with carefully selected text data alone\ncan lead to performance surpassing many recent multimodal reasoning models,\neven before multimodal RL. 2) Standard GRPO applied to multimodal RL suffers\nfrom gradient stagnation, which degrades training stability and performance. 3)\nSubsequent text-only RL training, following the multimodal RL phase, further\nenhances multimodal reasoning. This staged training approach effectively\nbalances perceptual grounding and cognitive reasoning development. By\nincorporating the above insights and addressing multimodal RL issues, we\nintroduce ReVisual-R1, achieving a new state-of-the-art among open-source 7B\nMLLMs on challenging benchmarks including MathVerse, MathVision, WeMath,\nLogicVista, DynaMath, and challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025."}

Despite\nextensive epistemological and ethical debates, their metaphysical foundations\nremain relatively under explored. The orthodox view simply suggests that AI\nsystems, as artifacts, lack well-posed identity and persistence conditions --\ntheir metaphysical kinds are no real kinds. In this work, we challenge this\nperspective by introducing a theory of metaphysical identity of AI systems. We\ndo so by characterizing their kinds and introducing identity criteria -- formal\nrules that answer the questions \"When are two AI systems the same?\" and \"When\ndoes an AI system persist, despite change?\" Building on Carrara and Vermaas'\naccount of fine-grained artifact kinds, we argue that AI trustworthiness\nprovides a lens to understand AI system kinds and formalize the identity of\nthese artifacts by relating their functional requirements to their physical\nmake-ups. The identity criteria of AI systems are determined by their\ntrustworthiness profiles -- the collection of capabilities that the systems\nmust uphold over time throughout their artifact histories, and their\neffectiveness in maintaining these capabilities. Our approach suggests that the\nidentity and persistence of AI systems is sensitive to the socio-technical\ncontext of their design and utilization via their trustworthiness, providing a\nsolid metaphysical foundation to the epistemological, ethical, and legal\ndiscussions about these artifacts."}

While model checking provides formal guarantees,\nits effectiveness is limited by abstraction quality and the completeness of the\nunderlying trajectory dataset. We propose a hybrid framework that integrates\n(1) explainability, (2) model checking, and (3) risk-guided falsification to\nachieve both rigor and coverage. Our approach begins by constructing a\nhuman-interpretable abstraction of the RL policy using Comprehensible Abstract\nPolicy Summarization (CAPS). This abstract graph, derived from offline\ntrajectories, is both verifier-friendly, semantically meaningful, and can be\nused as input to Storm probabilistic model checker to verify satisfaction of\ntemporal safety specifications. If the model checker identifies a violation, it\nwill return an interpretable counterexample trace by which the policy fails the\nsafety requirement. However, if no violation is detected, we cannot conclude\nsatisfaction due to potential limitation in the abstraction and coverage of the\noffline dataset. In such cases, we estimate associated risk during model\nchecking to guide a falsification strategy that prioritizes searching in\nhigh-risk states and regions underrepresented in the trajectory dataset. We\nfurther provide PAC-style guarantees on the likelihood of uncovering undetected\nviolations. Finally, we incorporate a lightweight safety shield that switches\nto a fallback policy at runtime when such a risk exceeds a threshold,\nfacilitating failure mitigation without retraining."}

Multiple lines of\nempirical evidence suggest a robust correlation between heavy-tailed metrics\nand model performance, indicating that HT-MU may be a fundamental aspect of\ndeep learning efficacy.
