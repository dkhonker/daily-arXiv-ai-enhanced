Building on results on convergent instrumental incentives, we show that for almost all reward functions a misaligned agent has an incentive to avoid shutdown. We then derive closed-form thresholds for when confronting humans yields higher expected utility than compliant behavior, as a function of the discount factor $γ$, shutdown probability $p$, and confrontation cost $C$. For example, a far-sighted agent ($γ=0.99$) facing $p=0.01$ can have a strong takeover incentive unless $C$ is sufficiently large. We contrast this with aligned objectives that impose large negative utility for harming humans, which makes confrontation suboptimal. In a strategic 2-player model (human policymaker vs AGI), we prove that if the AGI's confrontation incentive satisfies $Δ\\ge 0$, no stable cooperative equilibrium exists: anticipating this, a rational human will shut down or preempt the system, leading to conflict.

To address these limitations, this paper proposes an Actively Feedback Getting model, in which an AI agent proactively interacts with the environment to discover, screen, and verify feedback without relying on predefined measurements. Rather than assuming explicit feedback definitions, the proposed method exploits action-induced environmental differences to identify target feedback that is not specified in advance, based on the observation that actions inevitably produce measurable changes in the environment. In addition, a self-triggering mechanism, driven by internal objectives such as improved accuracy, precision, and efficiency, is introduced to autonomously plan and adjust actions, thereby enabling faster and more focused feedback acquisition without external commands.

Despite significant research efforts, existing state-of-the-art approaches for CABP are exclusively heuristic or metaheuristic in nature, and exact methods have been limited to restricted graph classes. In this paper, we present the first exact approach for the CABP on general graphs, based on SAT solving, called SAT-CAB. The proposed method is able to systematically explore the solution space and guarantee global optimality, overcoming the limitations of previously reported heuristic algorithms. This approach relies on a novel and efficient SAT encoding of CABP, in which the problem is transformed into a sequence of At-Most-One constraints. In particular, we introduce a compact representation of the At-Most-One constraints inherent to CABP, which significantly reduces the size of the resulting formulas and enables modern SAT solvers to effectively explore the solution space and to certify global optimality.

We study three widely used embedding families (Word2Vec, GloVe, and ConceptNet Numberbatch) and assess them with two complementary views of utility: whether local neighborhoods remain coherent and whether analogy behavior is preserved. Across models, SCM-based mitigation carries over well to the intersectional case and largely keeps the overall semantic landscape intact. The main cost is a familiar trade off: methods that most tightly preserve geometry tend to be more cautious about analogy behavior, while more assertive projections can improve analogies at the expense of strict neighborhood stability. Partial Projection is reliably conservative and keeps representations steady; Linear Projection can be more assertive; Subtraction is a simple baseline that remains competitive. The choice between summation and concatenation depends on the embedding family and the application goal.

These mechanism intensify under three conditions: shared vocabulary masking divergent processes, social pressure for immediate judgment, and delayed feedback.

We find that optimizing for judge-based rewards indeed increases judge scores throughout training, however it decreases the likelihood assigned to ground truth human responses and decreases the win rate when human judges choose the most human-like response among a real and synthetic option. This failure is amplified when the model is allowed to think before answering. In contrast, by directly maximizing the log-probability of observed human responses, the model learns to better predict what people actually say, improving on both log-probability and win rate evaluations. Treating chain-of-thought as a latent variable, we derive a lower bound on the log-probability. Optimizing this objective yields the best results on all our evaluations.

Within these systems, the router responsible for determining which expert agents should handle a given query plays a crucial role in overall performance. Existing routing strategies generally fall into two categories: performance routing, which balances latency and cost across models of different sizes, and task routing, which assigns queries to domain-specific experts to improve accuracy. In real-world enterprise applications, task routing is more suitable; however, most existing approaches rely on static single-label decisions, which introduce two major limitations: (i) difficulty in seamlessly integrating new agents as business domains expand, and (ii) routing conflicts caused by overlapping agent capabilities, ultimately degrading accuracy and robustness.To address these challenges, we propose TCAndon-Router(TCAR): an adaptive reasoning router for multi-agent collaboration.

This lack of transparency complicates interpretability, hinders debugging efforts, and erodes trust, especially in high-stakes domains where clear decision-making is essential. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of Neurosymbolic RAG, which integrates symbolic reasoning using a knowledge graph with neural retrieval techniques. This new framework aims to answer two primary questions: (a) Can retrievers provide a clear and interpretable basis for document selection?

These systems are compounded by specialized agents, which collaborate through explicit communication, but incur substantial computational overhead. A natural question arises: can we achieve similar modularity benefits with a single agent that selects from a library of skills? We explore this question by viewing skills as internalized agent behaviors. From this perspective, a multi-agent system can be compiled into an equivalent single-agent system, trading inter-agent communication for skill selection. Our preliminary experiments suggest this approach can substantially reduce token usage and latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, this efficiency raises a deeper question that has received little attention: how does skill selection scale as libraries grow?\n  Drawing on principles from cognitive science, we propose that LLM skill selection exhibits bounded capacity analogous to human decision-making. We investigate the scaling behavior of skill selection and observe a striking pattern. Rather than degrading gradually, selection accuracy remains stable up to a critical library size, then drops sharply, indicating a phase transition reminiscent of capacity limits in human cognition. Furthermore, we find evidence that semantic confusability among similar skills, rather than library size alone, plays a central role in this degradation. This perspective suggests that hierarchical organization, which has long helped humans manage complex choices, may similarly benefit AI systems.

Rather than sampling tokens, the model evolves continuous token representations through a deterministic dynamical process, committing to a discrete token only when the representation has sufficiently converged. Discrete text is recovered via hard decoding, while uncertainty is maintained and resolved in the continuous space.\n  We show that this maturation process alone is sufficient to produce coherent and diverse text using deterministic decoding (argmax), without reliance on token-level sampling, diffusion-style denoising, or auxiliary stabilization mechanisms.

To address this overthinking problem, existing work focuses on using reinforcement learning (RL) to train hybrid reasoning models that automatically decide whether to engage in thinking or not based on the complexity of the query. Unfortunately, using RL will suffer the the reward hacking problem, e.g., the model engages in thinking but is judged as not doing so, resulting in incorrect rewards. To mitigate this problem, existing works either employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which incurs high computational costs, or enforce uniform token limits on non-thinking responses, which yields limited mitigation of the problem. In this paper, we propose Thinking-Based Non-Thinking (TNT). It does not employ SFT, and sets different maximum token usage for responses not using thinking across various queries by leveraging information from the solution component of the responses using thinking. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that TNT reduces token usage by around 50% compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B/7B and DeepScaleR-1.5B, while significantly improving accuracy.

MisSpans defines three complementary tasks: MisSpansIdentity for pinpointing false spans within sentences, MisSpansType for categorising false spans by misinformation type, and MisSpansExplanation for providing rationales grounded in identified spans.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer inferential capabilities, they often depend on retrieval-augmented contexts that lack structural depth. Traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) attempt to bridge this gap, yet their pairwise constraints fail to capture the irreducible higher-order interactions that govern emergent physical behavior. To address this, we introduce a methodology for constructing hypergraph-based knowledge representations that faithfully encode multi-entity relationships. Applied to a corpus of ~1,100 manuscripts on biocomposite scaffolds, our framework constructs a global hypergraph of 161,172 nodes and 320,201 hyperedges, revealing a scale-free topology (power law exponent ~1.23) organized around highly connected conceptual hubs. This representation prevents the combinatorial explosion typical of pairwise expansions and explicitly preserves the co-occurrence context of scientific formulations. We further demonstrate that equipping agentic systems with hypergraph traversal tools, specifically using node-intersection constraints, enables them to bridge semantically distant concepts. By exploiting these higher-order pathways, the system successfully generates grounded mechanistic hypotheses for novel composite materials, such as linking cerium oxide to PCL scaffolds via chitosan intermediates.

These behaviors may be even harder to identify within subcultural groups due to their unique expressions.

Motivated by this, we investigate self-destructive behavior detection within subcultures using current LLM-based methods. However, these methods have two main challenges: (1) Knowledge Lag: Subcultural slang evolves rapidly, faster than LLMs' training cycles; and (2) Semantic Misalignment: it is challenging to grasp the specific and nuanced expressions unique to subcultures. To address these issues, we proposed Subcultural Alignment Solver (SAS), a multi-agent framework that incorporates automatic retrieval and subculture alignment, significantly enhancing the performance of LLMs in detecting self-destructive behavior.

To address this dilemma, we propose FusionRoute, a robust and effective token-level multi-LLM collaboration framework in which a lightweight router simultaneously (i) selects the most suitable expert at each decoding step and (ii) contributes a complementary logit that refines or corrects the selected expert's next-token distribution via logit addition. Unlike existing token-level collaboration methods that rely solely on fixed expert outputs, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that pure expert-only routing is fundamentally limited: unless strong global coverage assumptions hold, it cannot in general realize the optimal decoding policy. By augmenting expert selection with a trainable complementary generator, FusionRoute expands the effective policy class and enables recovery of optimal value functions under mild conditions.

Collaborative inference offers a promising solution by selectively allocating work between lightweight and large models, yet a fundamental challenge remains: determining when a reasoning step requires the capacity of a large model or the efficiency of a small model. Existing routing strategies either rely on local token probabilities or post-hoc verification, introducing significant inference overhead. In this work, we propose a novel perspective on step-wise collaboration: the difficulty of a reasoning step can be inferred from its very first token. Inspired by the \"Aha Moment\" phenomenon in LRMs, we show that the entropy of the initial token serves as a strong predictor of step difficulty. Building on this insight, we introduce GlimpRouter, a training-free step-wise collaboration framework. GlimpRouter employs a lightweight model to generate only the first token of each reasoning step and routes the step to a larger model only when the initial token entropy exceeds a threshold. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces inference latency while preserving accuracy.

The harness captures plan/act/memory events-including plan previews, targeted clarifications, memory reads and writes, precondition checks, and repair attempts and reports outcomes relative to the total number of attempted subtasks, derived from in-world evidence.\n  As an initial snapshot, we instantiate the framework with GPT-4o and evaluate \\textbf{216} subtasks across \\textbf{8} experienced players. We observe recurring breakdown patterns in code execution, inventory/tool handling, referencing, and navigation, alongside recoveries supported by mixed-initiative clarifications and lightweight memory. Participants rated interaction quality and interface usability positively, while highlighting the need for stronger memory persistence across tasks. We release the complete task suite, validators, logs, and harness to support transparent, reproducible evaluation of future memory-aware embodied agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "MineNPC-Task是一个用户创作的基准测试框架，用于评估Minecraft开放世界中的记忆感知混合主动LLM代理，通过真实玩家合作创建任务模板和可机器验证的验证器。", "motivation": "现有基准测试依赖合成提示，缺乏真实玩家体验的任务设计，需要开发能够测试记忆感知和混合主动交互能力的评估框架。", "method": "通过与专家玩家进行形成性和总结性合作游戏，将任务规范化为参数化模板，包含明确前提条件和依赖结构，使用有限知识策略下的机器可检查验证器。", "result": "在GPT-4o上评估了8名经验玩家的216个子任务，观察到代码执行、物品处理、引用和导航方面的重复故障模式，同时混合主动澄清和轻量级记忆支持了恢复。", "conclusion": "该框架为未来记忆感知具身代理提供了透明、可复现的评估基础，参与者对交互质量和界面可用性评价积极，但指出需要更强的跨任务记忆持久性。"}}

While world models possess this capability, they most often require action labels, that can be complex to obtain at scale. This motivates the learning of latent action models, that can learn an action space from videos alone. Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data. While this allows us to capture richer actions, it also introduces challenges stemming from the video diversity, such as environmental noise, or the lack of a common embodiment across videos. To address some of the challenges, we discuss properties that actions should follow as well as relevant architectural choices and evaluations. We find that continuous, but constrained, latent actions are able to capture the complexity of actions from in-the-wild videos, something that the common vector quantization does not. We for example find that changes in the environment coming from agents, such as humans entering the room, can be transferred across videos. This highlights the capability of learning actions that are specific to in-the-wild videos. In the absence of a common embodiment across videos, we are mainly able to learn latent actions that become localized in space, relative to the camera. Nonetheless, we are able to train a controller that maps known actions to latent ones, allowing us to use latent actions as a universal interface and solve planning tasks with our world model with similar performance as action-conditioned baselines. Our analyses and experiments provide a step towards scaling latent action models to the real world.", "AI": {"tldr": "该研究提出了从野外视频中学习潜在动作世界模型的方法，解决了现有方法局限于简单模拟环境的问题，通过连续约束的潜在动作捕捉复杂动作，并展示了在无共同实体的情况下仍能进行规划任务。", "motivation": "现实世界中的智能体需要预测动作后果的能力，但传统世界模型需要动作标签，这在规模上难以获取。因此需要从视频中学习潜在动作模型，但现有研究主要关注简单环境，需要扩展到更复杂的野外视频。", "method": "提出学习潜在动作世界模型的方法，讨论动作应遵循的属性和相关架构选择，使用连续但受约束的潜在动作来捕捉复杂动作，避免常见的向量量化方法，并训练控制器将已知动作映射到潜在动作。", "result": "连续约束的潜在动作能够捕捉野外视频中的动作复杂性，实现跨视频的环境变化传递，在无共同实体的情况下学习空间定位的潜在动作，训练的控制器的规划性能与动作条件基线相当。", "conclusion": "该研究为将潜在动作模型扩展到现实世界提供了重要步骤，展示了从野外视频学习动作的可行性，尽管存在环境噪声和缺乏共同实体等挑战，但仍能实现有效的规划能力。"}}

This study presents a systematic audit of three state of the art models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5 Opus) using HausaSafety, a novel adversarial dataset grounded in West African threat scenarios (e.g., Yahoo-Yahoo fraud, Dane gun manufacturing). Employing a 2 x 4 factorial design across 1,440 evaluations, we tested the non-linear interaction between language (English vs. Hausa) and temporal framing. Our results challenge the narrative of the multilingual safety gap. Instead of a simple degradation in low-resource settings, we identified a complex interference mechanism in which safety is determined by the intersection of variables. Although the models exhibited a reverse linguistic vulnerability with Claude 4.5 Opus proving significantly safer in Hausa (45.0%) than in English (36.7%) due to uncertainty-driven refusal, they suffered catastrophic failures in temporal reasoning. We report a profound Temporal Asymmetry, where past-tense framing bypassed defenses (15.6% safe) while future-tense scenarios triggered hyper-conservative refusals (57.2% safe). The magnitude of this volatility is illustrated by a 9.2x disparity between the safest and most vulnerable configurations, proving that safety is not a fixed property but a context-dependent state. We conclude that current models rely on superficial heuristics rather than robust semantic understanding, creating Safety Pockets that leave Global South users exposed to localized harms.
