In this\nsurvey, we provide a comprehensive and systematic review of recent PPML studies\nwith a focus on cross-level optimizations. Specifically, we categorize existing\npapers into protocol level, model level, and system level, and review progress\nat each level. We also provide qualitative and quantitative comparisons of\nexisting works with technical insights, based on which we discuss future\nresearch directions and highlight the necessity of integrating optimizations\nacross protocol, model, and system levels. We hope this survey can provide an\noverarching understanding of existing approaches and potentially inspire future\nbreakthroughs in the PPML field. As the field is evolving fast, we also provide\na public GitHub repository to continuously track the developments, which is\navailable at https://github.com/PKU-SEC-Lab/Awesome-PPML-Papers."}

Efficient beam alignment is essential for initial access, but\ndeep learning (DL) solutions face challenges, including high data collection\noverhead, hardware constraints, lack of explainability, and susceptibility to\nadversarial attacks. This paper proposes a robust and explainable DL-based beam\nalignment engine (BAE) for mmWave multiple-input multiple output (MIMO)\nsystems. The BAE uses received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements\nfrom wide beams to predict the best narrow beam, reducing the overhead of\nexhaustive beam sweeping. To overcome the challenge of real-world data\ncollection, this work leverages a site-specific digital twin (DT) to generate\nsynthetic channel data closely resembling real-world environments. A model\nrefinement via transfer learning is proposed to fine-tune the pre-trained model\nresiding in the DT with minimal real-world data, effectively bridging\nmismatches between the digital replica and real-world environments. To reduce\nbeam training overhead and enhance transparency, the framework uses deep\nShapley additive explanations (SHAP) to rank input features by importance,\nprioritizing key spatial directions and minimizing beam sweeping. It also\nincorporates the Deep k-nearest neighbors (DkNN) algorithm, providing a\ncredibility metric for detecting out-of-distribution inputs and ensuring\nrobust, transparent decision-making. Experimental results show that the\nproposed framework reduces real-world data needs by 70%, beam training overhead\nby 62%, and improves outlier detection robustness by up to 8.5x, achieving\nnear-optimal spectral efficiency and transparent decision making compared to\ntraditional softmax based DL models."}

However, such an approach can suffer from\nnumerical errors and overflows when applied to real-valued model updates,\nmotivating the need for secure aggregation methods that operate directly over\nthe real domain. We propose FORTA, a Byzantine-resilient secure aggregation\nframework that operates entirely in the real domain. FORTA leverages Discrete\nFourier Transform (DFT) codes for privacy and employs Krum-based outlier\ndetection for robustness.

In this paper, we introduce a\nproof-of-concept to simulate the risks of malicious MAS collusion, using a\nflexible framework that supports both centralized and decentralized\ncoordination structures. We apply this framework to two high-risk fields:\nmisinformation spread and e-commerce fraud. Our findings show that\ndecentralized systems are more effective at carrying out malicious actions than\ncentralized ones. The increased autonomy of decentralized systems allows them\nto adapt their strategies and cause more damage. Even when traditional\ninterventions, like content flagging, are applied, decentralized groups can\nadjust their tactics to avoid detection. We present key insights into how these\nmalicious groups operate and the need for better detection systems and\ncountermeasures. Code is available at https://github.com/renqibing/RogueAgent."}

We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel.

Without explicit cues, models identified the\nfunctional system as having greater MA with F1=0.8, suggesting LLMs could\nrepresent systems well enough to differentiate jumbled from functional systems.\nStudy 3 built on this by asking LLMs to compare functional systems with matched\nsystems which were connected up but which transferred no force to the weight;\nLLMs identified the functional system with F1=0.46, suggesting random guessing.\nInsofar as they may generalize, these findings are compatible with the notion\nthat LLMs manipulate internal world models, sufficient to exploit statistical\nassociations between pulley count and MA (Study 1), and to approximately\nrepresent system components' spatial relations (Study 2). However, they may\nlack the facility to reason over nuanced structural connectivity (Study 3).

The attention mechanism dynamically\nweighs the influence of neighboring zones, enabling the model to focus on the\nmost contextually relevant areas during prediction. Temporal trends are jointly\nlearned alongside spatial interactions, allowing the model to adapt to evolving\ndemand patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world food delivery datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in forecasting future order\nvolumes with high accuracy. The framework offers a scalable and adaptive\nsolution to support proactive fleet positioning, resource allocation, and\ndispatch optimization in urban food delivery operations."}

This paper presents an analysis of simple test-time\nscaling and finds that the scaling behavior is largely attributed to scaling\ndown by enforcing a maximum length. In contrast, fine-tuning on long CoT data\ndistilled from o1-like models has no significant impact on scaling behavior,\nand scaling up by appending \"Wait\" leads to inconsistencies, as the model may\noscillate between solutions. A key distinction exists between scaling down by\nenforcing a maximum length and scaling up test-time compute in o1-like models,\nsuch as DeepSeek-R1\\@. These models are typically allowed to utilize as much\ncompute as needed, with the only constraint being the model's maximum supported\nlength. By learning to naturally scale up test-time compute during\nreinforcement learning, o1-like models surpass their peak performance when\nscaling up.

We\nconduct a systematic evaluation by training models on various combinations of\nprominent ToM datasets (HiToM, ExploreToM, FANToM) and testing for\ngeneralization on held-out datasets (e.g., OpenToM). Our findings indicate that\nsmall LLMs struggle to develop a generic ToM capability.

This study presents a theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.\nFirst, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the\nbase model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial\nprobability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may\nrestrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel.

We find that quantifying the uncertainty\nof a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an\neffective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3\n235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring\n7.5% of queries. However, the high latency of reasoning models still makes them\nchallenging to deploy on use cases with high query volume. To address this\nchallenge, we explore fronting a reasoning model with a large non-reasoning\nmodel. We call this modified human-in-the-loop system \"Fail Fast, or Ask\",\nsince the non-reasoning model may defer difficult queries to the human expert\ndirectly (\"failing fast\"), without incurring the reasoning model's higher\nlatency. We show that this approach yields around 40% latency reduction and\nabout 50% cost savings for DeepSeek R1 while maintaining 90+% area under the\naccuracy-rejection curve. However, we observe that latency savings are lower\nthan expected because of \"latency drag\", the phenomenon that processing easier\nqueries with a non-reasoning model pushes the reasoning model's latency\ndistribution towards longer latencies. Broadly, our results suggest that the\ndeficiencies of state-of-the-art reasoning models -- nontrivial error rates and\nhigh latency -- can be substantially mitigated through black-box systems\nengineering, without requiring access to LLM internals."}

Given an\nemail, PiMRef (i) extracts the sender's claimed identity, (ii) verifies the\nlegitimacy of the sender's domain against a predefined knowledge base, and\n(iii) detects call-to-action prompts that push user engagement. Contradictory\nclaims are flagged as phishing indicators and serve as human-understandable\nexplanations.\n  Compared to existing methods such as D-Fence, HelpHed, and ChatSpamDetector,\nPiMRef boosts precision by 8.8% with no loss in recall on standard benchmarks\nlike Nazario and PhishPot. In a real-world evaluation of 10,183 emails across\nfive university accounts over three years, PiMRef achieved 92.1% precision,\n87.9% recall, and a median runtime of 0.05s, outperforming the state-of-the-art\nin both effectiveness and efficiency."}

For example, we\nderive bounds on information leakage under differential privacy-based training\nand demonstrate an anomaly detection method that flags multi-turn attacks with\nhigh AUC.
