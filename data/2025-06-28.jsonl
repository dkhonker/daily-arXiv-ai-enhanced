On two natural settings (1) generalization gap for flat solutions, and\n(2) mean-squared error (MSE) in nonparametric function estimation by stable\nminima, we prove upper and lower bounds, which establish that while flatness\ndoes imply generalization, the resulting rates of convergence necessarily\ndeteriorate exponentially as the input dimension grows. This gives an\nexponential separation between the flat solutions vis-\\`a-vis low-norm\nsolutions (i.e., weight decay), which knowingly do not suffer from the curse of\ndimensionality. In particular, our minimax lower bound construction, based on a\nnovel packing argument with boundary-localized ReLU neurons, reveals how flat\nsolutions can exploit a kind of ''neural shattering'' where neurons rarely\nactivate, but with high weight magnitudes.

This is due to a remarkable property of Gaussian\ninvariance that allows us to obtain exact analytical solutions to the Poisson\nequation for Gaussian targets. These solutions can be used to construct\nefficient and easy to use control variates for variance reduction of estimators\nunder any intractable target. We demonstrate the new samplers and estimators in\nseveral examples, including high dimensional targets in latent Gaussian models\nwhere we compare against several advanced methods and obtain state-of-the-art\nresults.

To address this vulnerability, we propose an\nantifragile RL framework designed to adapt against curriculum of incremental\nadversarial perturbations. The framework introduces a simulated attacker which\nincrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which\nenables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD\nobservations and anticipate previously unseen attacks. We begin with a\ntheoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic\nforgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with\nincreasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as\nthe boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under\nwhich forgetting is stabilized.

Monitor Memorization-to-Generalization without Test", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Grokking, i.e., test performance keeps improving long after training loss\nconverged, has been recently witnessed in neural network training, making the\nmechanism of generalization and other emerging capabilities such as reasoning\nmysterious. While prior studies usually train small models on a few toy or\nhighly-specific tasks for thousands of epochs, we conduct the first study of\ngrokking on checkpoints during one-pass pretraining of a 7B large language\nmodel (LLM), i.e., OLMoE. We compute the training loss and evaluate\ngeneralization on diverse benchmark tasks, including math reasoning, code\ngeneration, and commonsense/domain-specific knowledge retrieval tasks.\n  Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still happens in the\npretraining of large-scale foundation models, though different data may enter\ngrokking stages asynchronously. We further demystify grokking's \"emergence of\ngeneralization\" by investigating LLM internal dynamics. Specifically, we find\nthat training samples' pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers) evolve\nfrom random, instance-specific to more structured and shareable between samples\nduring grokking. Also, the complexity of a sample's pathway reduces despite the\nconverged loss. These indicate a memorization-to-generalization conversion,\nproviding a mechanistic explanation of delayed generalization. In the study, we\ndevelop two novel metrics to quantify pathway distance and the complexity of a\nsingle pathway. We show their ability to predict the generalization improvement\non diverse downstream tasks. They are efficient, simple to compute and solely\ndependent on training data. Hence, they have practical value for pretraining,\nenabling us to monitor the generalization performance without finetuning and\ntest. Theoretically, we show that more structured pathways reduce model\ncomplexity and improve the generalization bound."}

Existing work either\nrequires interpolation or focuses only on univariate inputs. This paper\npresents new and somewhat surprising theoretical results for multivariate\ninputs. On two natural settings (1) generalization gap for flat solutions, and\n(2) mean-squared error (MSE) in nonparametric function estimation by stable\nminima, we prove upper and lower bounds, which establish that while flatness\ndoes imply generalization, the resulting rates of convergence necessarily\ndeteriorate exponentially as the input dimension grows. This gives an\nexponential separation between the flat solutions vis-\\`a-vis low-norm\nsolutions (i.e., weight decay), which knowingly do not suffer from the curse of\ndimensionality. In particular, our minimax lower bound construction, based on a\nnovel packing argument with boundary-localized ReLU neurons, reveals how flat\nsolutions can exploit a kind of ''neural shattering'' where neurons rarely\nactivate, but with high weight magnitudes. This leads to poor performance in\nhigh dimensions. We corroborate these theoretical findings with extensive\nnumerical simulations.

While versatile LLMs appear to\nhave demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and\nproviding responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether\nthey perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence\nindicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing\nshallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal\nknowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine\nhuman-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,\nmethodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of\ntransformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.\nEmpirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,\nwhose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs\nexhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier\nbenchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal\nreasoning.
