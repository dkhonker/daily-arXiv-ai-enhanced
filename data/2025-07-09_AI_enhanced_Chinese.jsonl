When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans\nare utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading\nto further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a\nuser-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study\nproposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous\ndescriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT)\nresults, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or\nring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS)\nsoftware and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first\nleverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan\ndescriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and\nphase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python\nscripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic\nsignal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan.\nWithin a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan\nediting. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of\nover 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300\nplan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of\nunderstanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an\neasy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers,\nserving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile\napplication of LLMs in the field of ITS.

However, as the\nnetwork depth increases, the issue of over-smoothing becomes more severe,\ncausing node representations to lose their distinctiveness. This paper analyzes\nthe mechanism of over-smoothing through the analogy to Anderson localization\nand introduces participation degree as a metric to quantify this phenomenon.\nSpecifically, as the depth of the GNN increases, node features homogenize after\nmultiple layers of message passing, leading to a loss of distinctiveness,\nsimilar to the behavior of vibration modes in disordered systems.

However, the\ncommon lack of disclosure regarding their usage raises significant privacy and\ncopyright concerns. Dataset auditing techniques, which aim to determine if a\nspecific dataset was used to train a given suspicious model, provide promising\nsolutions to addressing these transparency gaps. While prior work has developed\nvarious auditing methods, their resilience against dedicated adversarial\nattacks remains largely unexplored. To bridge the gap, this paper initiates a\ncomprehensive study evaluating dataset auditing from an adversarial\nperspective. We start with introducing a novel taxonomy, classifying existing\nmethods based on their reliance on internal features (IF) (inherent to the\ndata) versus external features (EF) (artificially introduced for auditing).\nSubsequently, we formulate two primary attack types: evasion attacks, designed\nto conceal the use of a dataset, and forgery attacks, intending to falsely\nimplicate an unused dataset. Building on the understanding of existing methods\nand attack objectives, we further propose systematic attack strategies:\ndecoupling, removal, and detection for evasion; adversarial example-based\nmethods for forgery. These formulations and strategies lead to our new\nbenchmark, DATABench, comprising 17 evasion attacks, 5 forgery attacks, and 9\nrepresentative auditing methods. Extensive evaluations using DATABench reveal\nthat none of the evaluated auditing methods are sufficiently robust or\ndistinctive under adversarial settings. These findings underscore the urgent\nneed for developing a more secure and reliable dataset auditing method capable\nof withstanding sophisticated adversarial manipulation.

While existing research has primarily\nconcentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter\nregularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT\nremains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two\ncore post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement\nfine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge\nretention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising\nseven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base\nmodel for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant\nfindings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to\ncatastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT\ninherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to\nmulti-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the\nmodel's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).\nConversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis\nshows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought\nreasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit\nregularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting.\nFinally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the\nstability and efficiency of RFT.

This study\ncompares plans from human experts and two AI models (a generalist and a\nreasoner), assessed by both human peers and a superior AI judge.\n  Methods: Ten dermatologists, a generalist AI (GPT-4o), and a reasoning AI\n(o3) generated treatment plans for five complex dermatology cases. The\nanonymized, normalized plans were scored in two phases: 1) by the ten human\nexperts, and 2) by a superior AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) using an identical\nrubric.\n  Results: A profound 'evaluator effect' was observed. Human experts scored\npeer-generated plans significantly higher than AI plans (mean 7.62 vs. 7.16;\np=0.0313), ranking GPT-4o 6th (mean 7.38) and the reasoning model, o3, 11th\n(mean 6.97).

Yet these focus on architectural isolation while typically\noverlooking microarchitectural side channels, exemplified by Meltdown and\nForeshadow. Software must therefore supplement architectural defenses with\nad-hoc microarchitectural patches, which are constantly evolving as new attacks\nemerge and defenses are proposed. Such reactive approach makes ensuring\ncomplete isolation a daunting task, and leaves room for errors and oversights.\n  We address this problem by developing a tool that stress tests\nmicroarchitectural isolation between security domains such as virtual machines,\nkernel, and processes, with the goal of detecting flaws in the isolation\nboundaries. The tool extends model-based relational testing (MRT) methodology\nto enable detection of cross-domain information leakage. We design a new test\ncase generator and execution sandbox to handle multi-domain execution, new\nleakage models to encode expected leaks, and new analysis techniques to manage\nnondeterminism.\n  We use this tool to perform an in-depth testing campaign on six x86-64 CPUs\nfor leakage across different isolation boundaries.

A plethora of hardware accelerators has been\nintroduced to meet the performance demands of GNNs in real-world applications.\nHowever, security challenges of hardware-based attacks have been generally\noverlooked. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of GNN models to\nhardware-based fault attack, wherein an attacker attempts to misclassify output\nby modifying trained weight parameters through fault injection in a memory\ndevice. Thus, we propose Gradual Bit-Flip Fault Attack (GBFA), a layer-aware\nbit-flip fault attack, selecting a vulnerable bit in each selected weight\ngradually to compromise the GNN's performance by flipping a minimal number of\nbits. To achieve this, GBFA operates in two steps. First, a Markov model is\ncreated to predict the execution sequence of layers based on features extracted\nfrom memory access patterns, enabling the launch of the attack within a\nspecific layer. Subsequently, GBFA identifies vulnerable bits within the\nselected weights using gradient ranking through an in-layer search. We evaluate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed GBFA attack on various GNN models for node\nclassification tasks using the Cora and PubMed datasets.

Strikingly, on a standard\n11-benchmark evaluation suite (MATH, MMLU, etc.), our simple recipe matches the\nperformance of Tulu 3, a state-of-the-art open model tuned from the same base\nmodel while relying on much stronger supervisors (e.g., GPT-4o). Thus, delta\nlearning enables simpler and cheaper open recipes for state-of-the-art\npost-training. To better understand delta learning, we prove in logistic\nregression that the performance gap between two weak teacher models provides\nuseful signal for improving a stronger student.

By tackling these\nsystemic issues, we can unlock more scalable, efficient, and robust training\nmechanisms {with fewer communication rounds for convergence}, paving the way\nfor the widespread deployment of large-scale federated MoE-structured LAMs in\nedge computing with ultra-high communication efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef-\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5b9a\u91cf\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef-\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u8f6e\u6b21\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8054\u90a6MoE\u7ed3\u6784LAM\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u90e8\u7f72\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u590d\u6742\u7684MoE\u7ed3\u6784LAMs\u53d7\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u6311\u6218\u7684\u963b\u788d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7ba1\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u4f17\u591a\u4e13\u95e8\u4e13\u5bb6\u6240\u9700\u7684\u590d\u6742\u534f\u8c03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u65f6\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u8003\u8651\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef-\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u5168\u5c40\u4e13\u5bb6\u8d1f\u8f7d\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u80fd\u529b\u5256\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef-\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u8f6e\u6b21\u6536\u655b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u9501\u66f4\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u8d85\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8054\u90a6MoE\u7ed3\u6784LAM\u3002"}}

Although\ndomain-specific languages like Triton simplify GPU programming by abstracting\nlow-level details, developers must still manually tune critical parameters such\nas tile sizes and memory access patterns through iterative experimentation,\ncreating substantial barriers to optimal performance and wider adoption. In\nthis work, we introduce AutoTriton, the first model dedicated to Triton\nprogramming powered by reinforcement learning (RL). AutoTriton performs\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) to be equipped with essential Triton programming\nexpertise using a high-quality data gathering pipeline, and conducts RL with\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, combining a rule-based\nreward and an execution-based reward to further improve Triton programming\nability, sequentially. Experiments across five evaluation channels of\nTritonBench and KernelBench illustrate that our 8B model AutoTriton achieves\nperformance comparable to mainstream large models, including Claude-4-Sonnet\nand DeepSeek-R1-0528. Further experimental analysis demonstrates the crucial\nrole of each module within AutoTriton, including the SFT stage, the RL stage,\nand the reward design strategy. These findings underscore the promise of RL for\nautomatically generating high-performance kernels, and since high-performance\nkernels are core components of AI systems, this breakthrough establishes an\nimportant foundation for building more efficient AI systems.

The Select phase identifies a compact and diverse\nsubset using a diffusion difficulty score and interval sampling. The Attach\nphase enhances the selected subset by attaching rich semantic and visual\nrepresentations to strengthen the conditional signals. Extensive experiments\nacross various dataset sizes, model architectures, and resolutions show that\nour D2C framework enables significantly faster diffusion model training with\ndramatically fewer data, while preserving high visual quality. Notably, for the\nSiT-XL/2 architecture, D2C achieves a 100x training speed-up, reaching a FID\nscore of 4.3 in just 40k steps using only 0.8% of the training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes a novel Diffusion Dataset Condensation (D2C) framework to construct a synthetic sub-dataset with significantly fewer samples than the original dataset, enabling high-quality diffusion model training with greatly reduced cost.", "motivation": "From a data-centric perspective addressing the limitation that training diffusion models remains highly resource-intensive, diffusion dataset condensation is studied as a new and challenging problem setting.", "method": "A novel Diffusion Dataset Condensation (D2C) framework is proposed, which consists of two phases: Select and Attach.", "result": "Extensive experiments across various dataset sizes, model architectures, and resolutions show that our D2C framework enables significantly faster diffusion model training with dramatically fewer data, while preserving high visual quality.

This study examines expert assessment ambiguity in canine\nauscultation data, highlights the negative impact of label noise on\nclassification performance, and introduces methods for label noise reduction.\nTo evaluate whether label noise can be minimized by incorporating multiple\nexpert opinions, a dataset of 140 heart sound recordings (HSR) was annotated\nregarding the intensity of holosystolic heart murmurs caused by Myxomatous\nMitral Valve Disease (MMVD). The expert opinions facilitated the selection of\n70 high-quality HSR, resulting in a noise-reduced dataset. By leveraging\nindividual heart cycles, the training data was expanded and classification\nrobustness was enhanced. The investigation encompassed training and evaluating\nthree classification algorithms: AdaBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forest. While\nAdaBoost and Random Forest exhibited reasonable performances, XGBoost\ndemonstrated notable improvements in classification accuracy. All algorithms\nshowed significant improvements in classification accuracy due to the applied\nlabel noise reduction, most notably XGBoost. Specifically, for the detection of\nmild heart murmurs, sensitivity increased from 37.71% to 90.98% and specificity\nfrom 76.70% to 93.69%. For the moderate category, sensitivity rose from 30.23%\nto 55.81% and specificity from 64.56% to 97.19%. In the loud/thrilling\ncategory, sensitivity and specificity increased from 58.28% to 95.09% and from\n84.84% to 89.69%, respectively.

In this\nwork, the example of groundwater flow with heat transport is considered; this\ncorresponds to an advection-diffusion process under heterogeneous flow\nconditions, that is, spatially distributed material parameters and heat\nsources. Classical numerical simulations are costly and challenging due to high\nspatio-temporal resolution requirements and large domains. While often\ncomputationally more efficient, purely data-driven surrogate models face\ndifficulties, particularly in predicting the advection process, which is highly\nsensitive to input variations and involves long-range spatial interactions.\nTherefore, in this work, a Local-Global Convolutional Neural Network (LGCNN)\napproach is introduced. It combines a lightweight numerical surrogate for the\ntransport process (global) with convolutional neural networks for the\ngroundwater velocity and heat diffusion processes (local).
