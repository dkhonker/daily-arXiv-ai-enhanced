Recently, implicit CoT approaches have\nemerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed\n``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates\nCoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.\nHowever, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)\nthey fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning\n(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,\nresulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on\nreducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the\nconsiderable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning\ntoken. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned\nimplicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,\nwe design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic\nalignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce\nsemantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization.

The cornerstone\nof TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex\ncounseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management\nand a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session\nLoop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response\nstrategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.\nCrucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term\nadaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each\nsession and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our\napproach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical\ncases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,\nespecially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and\nTherapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in\nemulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior.
