One important feature of the\nworst-case DP guarantee is it naturally implies protections against adversaries\nwith less prior information, more sophisticated attack goals, and complex\nmeasures of a successful attack. However, the analytical tradeoffs between the\nadversarial model and the privacy protections conferred by DP are not well\nunderstood thus far. To that end, this work sheds light on what the worst-case\nguarantee of DP implies about the success of attackers that are more\nrepresentative of real-world privacy risks.\n  In this paper, we present a single flexible framework that generalizes and\nextends the patchwork of bounds on DP mechanisms found in prior work. Our\nframework allows us to compute high-probability guarantees for DP mechanisms on\na large family of natural attack settings that previous bounds do not capture.\nOne class of such settings is the approximate reconstruction of multiple\nindividuals' data, such as inferring nearly entire columns of a tabular data\nset from noisy marginals and extracting sensitive information from DP-trained\nlanguage models.\n  We conduct two empirical case studies to illustrate the versatility of our\nbounds and compare them to the success of state-of-the-art attacks.\nSpecifically, we study attacks that extract non-uniform PII from a DP-trained\nlanguage model, as well as multi-column reconstruction attacks where the\nadversary has access to some columns in the clear and attempts to reconstruct\nthe remaining columns for each person's record.

A\nfundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding,\nwhich determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a\n(sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all\npossible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic\nknowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground\nformulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other\nmethods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more\ncomputationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees\nof preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner.

We introduce the\nDesign-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles\nrequirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph\nnodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS\ncollapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total\nof 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1\n70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON\nvalidity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility,\nworkflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS\nmaintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage\nremained minimal (less than 20\\%). Code compatibility peaked at 100\\% under\nspecific 2AS settings but averaged below 50\\% for MAS. Only the\nreasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by\nDeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes)\nwhereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced\ndesign detail.

In this work, we critically examine the\nconcept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment\nmaps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural\nnetwork can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of\ncausal abstraction trivial and uninformative.
