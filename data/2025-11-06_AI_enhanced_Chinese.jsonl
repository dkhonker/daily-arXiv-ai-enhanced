The challenges posed by optimization problems are primarily\nmanifested in their non-convexity, high-dimensionality, black-box nature, and\nother unfavorable characteristics. Traditional zero-order or first-order\nmethods, which are often characterized by low efficiency, inaccurate gradient\ninformation, and insufficient utilization of optimization information, are\nill-equipped to address these challenges effectively. In recent years, the\nrapid development of large language models (LLM) has led to substantial\nimprovements in their language understanding and code generation capabilities.\nConsequently, the design of optimization algorithms leveraging large language\nmodels has garnered increasing attention from researchers. In this study, we\nchoose the fireworks algorithm(FWA) as the basic optimizer and propose a novel\napproach to assist the design of the FWA by incorporating multi-modal large\nlanguage model(MLLM). To put it simply, we propose the concept of Critical\nPart(CP), which extends FWA to complex high-dimensional tasks, and further\nutilizes the information in the optimization process with the help of the\nmulti-modal characteristics of large language models. We focus on two specific\ntasks: the \\textit{traveling salesman problem }(TSP) and \\textit{electronic\ndesign automation problem} (EDA). The experimental results show that FWAs\ngenerated under our new framework have achieved or surpassed SOTA results on\nmany problem instances.", "AI": {"tldr": "本研究提出了一种利用多模态大语言模型(MLLM)辅助烟花算法(FWA)设计的新方法，通过引入关键部分(CP)概念扩展FWA处理复杂高维任务，在旅行商问题(TSP)和电子设计自动化(EDA)问题上达到或超越SOTA结果。", "motivation": "传统零阶和一阶优化方法在处理非凸、高维、黑盒等复杂优化问题时效率低、梯度信息不准确、优化信息利用不足。随着大语言模型在语言理解和代码生成能力上的显著提升，利用LLM设计优化算法受到研究者关注。", "method": "以烟花算法(FWA)为基础优化器，结合多模态大语言模型(MLLM)，提出关键部分(CP)概念来扩展FWA处理复杂高维任务的能力，并利用MLLM的多模态特性充分挖掘优化过程中的信息。", "result": "实验结果表明，在新框架下生成的烟花算法在许多问题实例上达到或超越了最先进(SOTA)的结果，特别是在旅行商问题(TSP)和电子设计自动化问题(EDA)上表现优异。", "conclusion": "通过将多模态大语言模型与传统优化算法相结合，成功提升了烟花算法处理复杂优化问题的能力，为利用人工智能技术增强传统优化方法提供了有效途径，在复杂优化任务中展现出巨大潜力。"}}

Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data\naugmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between\ntext and target. Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD\nfocus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating\nexplanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by\ntheir over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that\nlack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it\ndifficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our\nstudy, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an\ninterpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target\nimplicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and\nexplicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers\nstance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the\nrelevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model\ntowards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales,\nthus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales\nbased on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive\ndimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's\nattitude towards the given target.

Conspiracy beliefs play a central role in the spread of\nmisinformation and in shaping distrust toward institutions, making them a\ncritical testbed for evaluating the social fidelity of LLMs. LLMs are\nincreasingly used as proxies for studying human behavior, yet little is known\nabout whether they reproduce higher-order psychological constructs such as a\nconspiratorial mindset. To bridge this research gap, we administer validated\npsychometric surveys measuring conspiracy mindset to multiple models under\ndifferent prompting and conditioning strategies. Our findings reveal that LLMs\nshow partial agreement with elements of conspiracy belief, and conditioning\nwith socio-demographic attributes produces uneven effects, exposing latent\ndemographic biases. Moreover, targeted prompts can easily shift model responses\ntoward conspiratorial directions, underscoring both the susceptibility of LLMs\nto manipulation and the potential risks of their deployment in sensitive\ncontexts.
