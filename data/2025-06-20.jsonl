Notably, $d_*$ can be significantly\nsmaller than the input dimension $d$. We prove that, under these conditions,\nthe optimal convergence rate for the excess 0-1 risk of classifiers is $$\n\\left( \\frac{1}{n}\n\\right)^{\\frac{\\beta\\cdot(1\\wedge\\beta)^q}{{\\frac{d_*}{s+1}+(1+\\frac{1}{s+1})\\cdot\\beta\\cdot(1\\wedge\\beta)^q}}}\\;\\;\\;,\n$$ which is independent of the input dimension $d$.

They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments,\nwhich can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting\nrich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable\nstructures for reasoning.\n  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception,\ncreating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this\nintegration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to\ngeneralize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate\nto analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.\n  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which\niteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of\nits entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural\nnetworks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a\nsymbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.\n  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2%\naccuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines.

While $\\mu$P showed impressive results\nin practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations\nwhen applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\\mu$P is the fact\nthat input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking\nthe width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally\nmuch larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical\nanalysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and\nsubsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics\n\\emph{interpolate between the $\\mu$P regime and another regime that we call\nLarge Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those\npredicted by $\\mu$P.

To effectively capture the system's\ntopology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both\nitem attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep\nwarehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network\narchitecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer\nmodel. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into\nembeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these\nembeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong\ngeneralization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage\nsystems with diverse layouts.

However, this assumption often does\nnot hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in\nreal-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily\nLearning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns. RHO consists of two\nnovel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph\nnormality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters\nthat capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with\nvarying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node\nattributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise\nand cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned\nby the filters in the two views.

AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning\nmodel to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the\nreasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified\nrule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers\nto compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as\nan auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy\noptimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\\%\nrelative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a\n6.1\\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,\ncompared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but\nwithout the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the\nextracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that\nAutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model\nwhen run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted\nrules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted\nrules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at\nhttps://github.com/cxcscmu/AutoRule."}

This paper focuses on\na limitation of the Advantage-Weighted Regression family (AWRs), i.e., the\npotential for learning over-conservative policies due to data corruption,\nspecifically the poor explorations in suboptimal offline data. We study it from\ntwo perspectives: (1) how poor explorations impact the theoretically optimal\npolicy based on KL divergence, and (2) how such poor explorations affect the\napproximation of the theoretically optimal policy. We prove that such\nover-conservatism is mainly caused by the sensitivity of the loss function for\npolicy optimization to poor explorations, and the proportion of poor\nexplorations in offline datasets. To address this concern, we propose\nCorruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), which incorporates a\nset of robust loss functions during policy optimization and an advantage-based\nprioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations. Numerical\nexperiments on the D4RL benchmark show that our method can learn superior\npolicies from suboptimal offline data, significantly enhancing the performance\nof policy optimization."}

Ideally, training an\nSAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.\nHowever, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \\emph{dense}), raising\nconcerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In\nthis work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of\ndense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect\nmeaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend\nto form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual\nstream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense\nfeatures in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an\nintrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense\nlatents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,\nentropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and\nprincipal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features\nevolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early\nlayers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented\nsignals in the last layers of the model.

Additionally,\nthe input before the final activation in the time-dependent classifier is a\nsecond-order approximation to the partial derivative, with respect to time, of\nthe logarithm of the density. We apply the proposed approach to approximate the\ntime-dependent probability density functions for systems driven by stochastic\nexcitations. We also use the proposed approach to synthesize new samples of a\nrandom vector from a given set of its realizations. In such applications, we\ngenerate sample paths necessary for training using stochastic interpolants.\nSubsequently, new samples are generated using gradient-based Markov chain Monte\nCarlo methods because automatic differentiation can efficiently provide the\nnecessary gradient.
