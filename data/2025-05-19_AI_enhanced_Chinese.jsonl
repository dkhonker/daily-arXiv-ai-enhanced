In certain scenarios, observations\nmade along trajectories of random dynamical systems are of particular interest.\nOne popular smoothing technique for such a scenario is exponential moving\naveraging (EMA), which assigns observations a weight that decreases\nexponentially in their age, thus giving younger observations a larger weight.\nHowever, EMA fails to enjoy strong stochastic convergence properties, which\nstems from the fact that the weight assigned to the youngest observation is\nconstant over time, preventing the noise in the averaged quantity from\ndecreasing to zero. In this work, we consider an adaptation to EMA, which we\ncall $p$-EMA, where the weights assigned to the last observations decrease to\nzero at a subharmonic rate.

The method\nrecovers policies on the Pareto front whenever the front is attainable;\npractically, it reduces to simple closed-form iterative updates suitable for\nlarge-scale training. On synthetic benchmarks with diverse canonical preference\nstructures, we show that MOPO approximates the Pareto front.
