One\nof them is concept drift, which is characterized by the change in data\ndistribution over time. Among many approaches explored in literature, the\nfusion of classifiers has been showing good results and is getting growing\nattention. DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an\nefficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid\nto adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order\nto create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may\nbecome prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data. In this work, we\npropose IncA-DES, which employs a training strategy that promotes the\ngeneration of local experts with the assumption that different regions of the\nfeature space become available with time. Additionally, the fusion of a concept\ndrift detector supports the maintenance of information and adaptation to a new\nconcept. An overlap-based classification filter is also employed in order to\navoid using the DS method when there is a consensus in the neighborhood, a\nstrategy that we argue every DS method should employ, as it was shown to make\nthem more applicable and quicker. Moreover, aiming to reduce the processing\ntime of the kNN, we propose an Online K-d tree algorithm, which can quickly\nremove instances without becoming inconsistent and deals with unbalancing\nconcerns that may occur in data streams.

A vanity address is\nan address that embeds custom characters such as a name.

In this paper, we focus on the\nfunctionality of identity-based signatures (IBS) where any strings can be\nemployed as a verification key, and explore whether IBS can be used for\ngenerating a vanity address. We attach importance to the fact that it is not\nrealistic to replace ECDSA with key recovery, which is currently employed for\nissuing transactions in Ethereum, to an IBS scheme. Even if this replacement is\npossible, it is not a reasonable price for the ease of the vanity address\ngeneration. Thus, we pay attention to a generic construction of IBS from\nsignatures, and construct an IBS scheme from ECDSA with key recovery. Though we\ncannot directly generate a vanity address due to the key recovery functionality\nof the underlying ECDSA, we can connect any string with an address due to the\nfunctionality of IBS that can give additional meaning to the address. We\nimplement our system by Solidity, and demonstrate that the gas cost is almost\nsame as that of the ECDSA signature verification."}

Prior research has focused on runtime performance: improving training\nefficiency and stability. This work focuses instead on the increasingly\ncritical issue of startup overhead in training: the delay before training jobs\nbegin execution. Startup overhead is particularly important in large,\nindustrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams\noperate in iterative update-debug cycles. In one of our training clusters, more\nthan 3.5% of GPU time is wasted due to startup overhead alone.\n  In this work, we present the first in-depth characterization of LLM training\nstartup overhead based on real production data. We analyze the components of\nstartup cost, quantify its direct impact, and examine how it scales with job\nsize. These insights motivate the design of Bootseer, a system-level\noptimization framework that addresses three primary startup bottlenecks: (a)\ncontainer image loading, (b) runtime dependency installation, and (c) model\ncheckpoint resumption. To mitigate these bottlenecks, Bootseer introduces three\ntechniques: (a) hot block record-and-prefetch, (b) dependency snapshotting, and\n(c) striped HDFS-FUSE.

In parallel, recent work on\nGradient Descent (GD) has found a phenomenon called Edge of Stability (EoS), in\nwhich the largest eigenvalue of the NTK oscillates around a value inversely\nproportional to the step size. However, although follow-up works have explored\nthe underlying mechanism of such eigenvalue behavior in depth, the\nunderstanding of the behavior of the NTK eigenvectors during EoS is still\nmissing. This paper examines the dynamics of NTK eigenvectors during EoS in\ndetail. Across different architectures, we observe that larger learning rates\ncause the leading eigenvectors of the final NTK, as well as the full NTK\nmatrix, to have greater alignment with the training target. We then study the\nunderlying mechanism of this phenomenon and provide a theoretical analysis for\na two-layer linear network. Our study enhances the understanding of GD training\ndynamics in deep learning."}

Existing DCT methods\nmainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete\none-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their\napplications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of\ndata, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful\nmeasurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex\ndistributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the\nsame for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when\nassessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the\nissue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive\nMMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions.\nBased on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the\nNAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair.\nTheoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to\nMMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive\nexperiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images).\nFurthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample\ntesting problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than\nthe MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments."}

To bridge this gap, we present TRENN, a novel\ntempo-relational architecture that integrates: (i) an automatic temporal graph\nextractor, (ii) a tempo-relational encoder, (iii) a decoder for team construct\nprediction, and (iv) two complementary explainability modules. TRENN jointly\ncaptures relational and temporal team dynamics, providing a solid foundation\nfor MT-TRENN, which extends TReNN by replacing the decoder with a multi-task\nhead, enabling the model to learn shared Social Embeddings and simultaneously\npredict multiple team constructs, including Emergent Leadership, Leadership\nStyle, and Teamwork components. Experimental results demonstrate that our\napproach significantly outperforms approaches that rely exclusively on temporal\nor relational information. Additionally, experimental evaluation has shown that\nthe explainability modules integrated in MT-TRENN yield interpretable insights\nand actionable suggestions to support team improvement. These capabilities make\nour approach particularly well-suited for Human-Centered AI applications, such\nas intelligent decision-support systems in high-stakes collaborative\nenvironments."}

This research introduces GeoReg a regression model that integrates\ndiverse data sources, including satellite imagery and web-based geospatial\ninformation, to estimate these indicators even for data-scarce regions such as\ndeveloping countries. Our approach leverages the prior knowledge of large\nlanguage model (LLM) to address the scarcity of labeled data, with the LLM\nfunctioning as a data engineer by extracting informative features to enable\neffective estimation in few-shot settings. Specifically, our model obtains\ncontextual relationships between data features and the target indicator,\ncategorizing their correlations as positive, negative, mixed, or irrelevant.\nThese features are then fed into the linear estimator with tailored weight\nconstraints for each category. To capture nonlinear patterns, the model also\nidentifies meaningful feature interactions and integrates them, along with\nnonlinear transformations.

To combat these\nproblems, past research has looked at building neural networks entirely from\nLipschitz components. However, these techniques have not matured to the point\nwhere researchers have trained a modern architecture such as a transformer with\na Lipschitz certificate enforced beyond initialization. To explore this gap, we\nbegin by developing and benchmarking novel, computationally-efficient tools for\nmaintaining norm-constrained weight matrices. Applying these tools, we are able\nto train transformer models with Lipschitz bounds enforced throughout training.\nWe find that optimizer dynamics matter: switching from AdamW to Muon improves\nstandard methods -- weight decay and spectral normalization -- allowing models\nto reach equal performance with a lower Lipschitz bound. Inspired by Muon's\nupdate having a fixed spectral norm, we co-design a weight constraint method\nthat improves the Lipschitz vs. performance tradeoff on MLPs and 2M parameter\ntransformers. Our 2-Lipschitz transformer on Shakespeare text reaches\nvalidation accuracy 60%. Scaling to 145M parameters, our 10-Lipschitz\ntransformer reaches 21% accuracy on internet text. However, to match the\nNanoGPT baseline validation accuracy of 39.4%, our Lipschitz upper bound\nincreases to 10^264.

We argue that this\nprofound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and\nrefinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to\nas world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model\ninduction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in\nartificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static\nrepresentations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of\nthe efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through\ninteraction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we\nprovide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in\ncognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call\nfor a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI.\nConcretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully\ndesigned games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the\nunderlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We\ndetail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate\nmetrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid\nworld model induction.

However, these gains often persist\neven when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted\nrewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true\nreasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific\npatterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective\nand identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,\n\\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test\nproblems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation\nfragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are\nhighly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning\nconsistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic\nevaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting\nfixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve\nmultiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across\nstructurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and\nimproving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular\nbenchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and\nVAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for\nRL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,\nwith average declines of 48.0\\% on AMC23 and 58.3\\% on AIME24. These findings\nsuggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail\nto generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a\nprincipled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical\nreasoning."}
