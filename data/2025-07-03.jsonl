While effective, these\nmethods require substantial computational resources and extensive synthetic\ndata, thereby relaxing the original ZSL assumptions. In this paper, we propose\nFSIGenZ, a few-shot-inspired generative ZSL framework that reduces reliance on\nlarge-scale feature synthesis. Our key insight is that class-level attributes\nexhibit instance-level variability, i.e., some attributes may be absent or\npartially visible, yet conventional ZSL methods treat them as uniformly\npresent. To address this, we introduce Model-Specific Attribute Scoring (MSAS),\nwhich dynamically re-scores class attributes based on model-specific\noptimization to approximate instance-level variability without access to unseen\ndata. We further estimate group-level prototypes as clusters of instances based\non MSAS-adjusted attribute scores, which serve as representative synthetic\nfeatures for each unseen class. To mitigate the resulting data imbalance, we\nintroduce a Dual-Purpose Semantic Regularization (DPSR) strategy while training\na semantic-aware contrastive classifier (SCC) using these prototypes.\nExperiments on SUN, AwA2, and CUB benchmarks demonstrate that FSIGenZ achieves\ncompetitive performance using far fewer synthetic features."}

Quantization has emerged as a promising solution; however, its\neffectiveness is often limited by quantization errors arising from weight\ndistributions that are not quantization-friendly and the presence of activation\noutliers. To address these challenges, we introduce DBellQuant, an innovative\npost-training quantization (PTQ) framework that achieves nearly 1-bit weight\ncompression and 6-bit activation quantization with minimal performance\ndegradation. DBellQuant uses Learnable Transformation for Dual-Bell (LTDB)\nalgorithm, which transforms single-bell weight distributions into dual-bell\nforms to reduce binarization errors and applies inverse transformations to\nsmooth activations. DBellQuant sets a new state-of-the-art by preserving\nsuperior model performance under aggressive weight and activation quantization.\nFor example, on the Wikitext2 dataset, DBellQuant achieves a perplexity of\n14.39 on LLaMA2-13B with 6-bit activation quantization, significantly\noutperforming BiLLM's 21.35 without activation quantization, underscoring its\npotential in compressing LLMs for real-world applications."}

Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the\nactivation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution\nparameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and\nuncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of\na specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter\ncaptures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a\nmore trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ\na fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous\nmodalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and\nrobustness.

To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel\nmetrics, Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample\ncontributions and, for fidelity, the radii of nearest neighbor balls, our\nmetrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values.\nThrough analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics exhibit linear\nscore degradation as the proportion of poor samples increases.

To address\nthis, we pioneer the formal study of the First-Segment-Then-Aggregate (FSTA)\ndecomposition technique to accelerate iterative solvers.

We\nconsider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,\nconstraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be\nmandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what\nother properties could be considered as general principles for answer set\nsemantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three\naforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with\nexamples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we\nevolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by\nrefining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality\nw.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The\nprinciple of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is\nconstructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of\ncircular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the\nformalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world\nviews. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of\nwell-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.\nFourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS\nprinciples.

Specifically, k-CNF formulae are mapped into\nMILP problems, which are then encoded as weighted bipartite graphs and\nsubsequently fed into a GNN for training and testing. From a theoretical\nperspective: (i) we establish permutation and equivalence invariance results,\ndemonstrating that the method produces outputs that are stable under reordering\nof clauses and variables; (ii) we identify a theoretical limitation, showing\nthat for a class of formulae called foldable formulae, standard GNNs cannot\nalways distinguish satisfiable from unsatisfiable instances; (iii) we prove a\nuniversal approximation theorem, establishing that with Random Node\nInitialization (RNI), the method can approximate SAT solving to arbitrary\nprecision on finite datasets, that is, the GNN becomes approximately sound and\ncomplete on such datasets. Furthermore, we show that for unfoldable formulae,\nthe same approximation guarantee can be achieved without the need for RNI.\nFinally, we conduct an experimental evaluation of our approach, which show\nthat, despite the simplicity of the neural architecture, the method achieves\npromising results."}

While Transformers\nexcel at sequence modeling, their quadratic memory scaling with sequence length\nmakes them impractical for such settings. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)\noffer constant memory but train sequentially, and Temporal Convolutional\nNetworks (TCNs), though efficient, scale memory with kernel size. To address\nthis, we propose mGRADE (mininally Gated Recurrent Architecture with Delay\nEmbedding), a hybrid-memory system that integrates a temporal 1D-convolution\nwith learnable spacings followed by a minimal gated recurrent unit (minGRU).\nThis design allows the convolutional layer to realize a flexible delay\nembedding that captures rapid temporal variations, while the recurrent module\nefficiently maintains global context with minimal memory overhead. We validate\nour approach on two synthetic tasks, demonstrating that mGRADE effectively\nseparates and preserves multi-scale temporal features. Furthermore, on\nchallenging pixel-by-pixel image classification benchmarks, mGRADE consistently\noutperforms both pure convolutional and pure recurrent counterparts using\napproximately 20% less memory footprint, highlighting its suitability for\nmemory-constrained temporal processing at the edge.

In this\npaper, we critically re-examine this popular family of OOD detection\nprocedures, and we argue that these methods are fundamentally answering the\nwrong questions for OOD detection. There is no simple fix to this misalignment,\nsince a classifier trained only on in-distribution classes cannot be expected\nto identify OOD points; for instance, a cat-dog classifier may confidently\nmisclassify an airplane if it contains features that distinguish cats from\ndogs, despite generally appearing nothing alike. We find that uncertainty-based\nmethods incorrectly conflate high uncertainty with being OOD, while\nfeature-based methods incorrectly conflate far feature-space distance with\nbeing OOD. We show how these pathologies manifest as irreducible errors in OOD\ndetection and identify common settings where these methods are ineffective.\nAdditionally, interventions to improve OOD detection such as feature-logit\nhybrid methods, scaling of model and data size, epistemic uncertainty\nrepresentation, and outlier exposure also fail to address this fundamental\nmisalignment in objectives. We additionally consider unsupervised density\nestimation and generative models for OOD detection, which we show have their\nown fundamental limitations."}

In contrast to\nprior approaches, such as AdaLoRA, that rely on first-order (linearized)\napproximations of the loss function, SubLoRA utilizes second-order information\nto capture the potentially complex loss landscape by incorporating the Hessian\nmatrix. We show that the linearization becomes inaccurate and ill-conditioned\nwhen the LoRA parameters have been well optimized, motivating the need for a\nmore reliable and nuanced second-order formulation. To this end, we reformulate\nthe rank determination problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with a\nquadratic objective. However, solving this problem exactly is NP-hard in\ngeneral. To overcome the computational challenge, we introduce a submodular\nfunction maximization framework and devise a greedy algorithm with\napproximation guarantees. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition under\nwhich the rank-determination objective becomes submodular, and construct a\nclosed-form projection of the Hessian matrix that satisfies this condition\nwhile maintaining computational efficiency. Our method combines solid\ntheoretical foundations, second-order accuracy, and practical computational\nefficiency. We further extend SubLoRA to a joint optimization setting,\nalternating between LoRA parameter updates and rank determination under a rank\nbudget constraint. Extensive experiments on fine-tuning physics-informed neural\nnetworks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach. Results show that SubLoRA outperforms\nexisting methods in both rank determination and joint training performance."}

The model adopts a\ngeneralized additive structure, featuring a link function that quantifies the\npreference difference between two items and a pattern function that governs the\ndistribution over ordinal response levels. This framework encompasses classical\nbinary comparison models as special cases, by treating binary responses as\nbinarized versions of ordinal data. Within this framework, we show that\nbinarizing ordinal data can significantly improve the accuracy of ranking\nrecovery. Specifically, we prove that under the counting algorithm, the ranking\nerror associated with binary comparisons exhibits a faster exponential\nconvergence rate than that of ordinal data. Furthermore, we characterize a\nsubstantial performance gap between binary and ordinal data in terms of a\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) determined by the pattern function.
