Existing methods typically allocate\ndifferent frequencies within RoPE to encode 3D positional information. However,\nthese allocation strategies mainly rely on heuristics, lacking in-depth\ntheoretical analysis. In this paper, we first study how different allocation\nstrategies impact the long-context capabilities of VLMs. Our analysis reveals\nthat current multimodal RoPEs fail to reliably capture semantic similarities\nover extended contexts. To address this issue, we propose HoPE, a Hybrid of\nPosition Embedding designed to improve the long-context capabilities of VLMs.\nHoPE introduces a hybrid frequency allocation strategy for reliable semantic\nmodeling over arbitrarily long context, and a dynamic temporal scaling\nmechanism to facilitate robust learning and flexible inference across diverse\ncontext lengths. Extensive experiments across four video benchmarks on long\nvideo understanding and retrieval tasks demonstrate that HoPE consistently\noutperforms existing methods, confirming its effectiveness.

We extend a\nprevious work that utilizes soft labels for estimating the Bayes error, the\noptimal error rate, in two important ways. First, we theoretically investigate\nthe properties of the bias of the hard-label-based estimator discussed in the\noriginal work. We reveal that the decay rate of the bias is adaptive to how\nwell the two class-conditional distributions are separated, and it can decay\nsignificantly faster than the previous result suggested as the number of hard\nlabels per instance grows.

Therefore, automatically resolving agent issues (i.e.,\nbug reports or feature requests) is a crucial and challenging task. While\nrecent software engineering (SE) agents (e.g., SWE-agent) have shown promise in\naddressing issues in traditional software systems, it remains unclear how\neffectively they can resolve real-world issues in agent systems, which differ\nsignificantly from traditional software. To fill this gap, we first manually\nanalyze 201 real-world agent issues and identify common categories of agent\nissues. We then spend 500 person-hours constructing AGENTISSUE-BENCH, a\nreproducible benchmark comprising 50 agent issue resolution tasks (each with an\nexecutable environment and failure-triggering tests). We further evaluate\nstate-of-the-art SE agents on AGENTISSUE-BENCH and reveal their limited\neffectiveness (i.e., with only 3.33% - 12.67% resolution rates). These results\nunderscore the unique challenges of maintaining agent systems compared to\ntraditional software, highlighting the need for further research to develop\nadvanced SE agents for resolving agent issues.

This setting captures a fundamental non-convex\nproblem at the intersection of representation learning and nonlinear\nregression. We analyze the gradient flow dynamics of a natural alternating\nscheme and prove convergence, with a rate controlled by the information\nexponent reflecting the \\textit{Gaussian regularity} of the function\n$\\varphi^\\star$. Strikingly, our analysis shows that convergence still occurs\neven when the initial direction is negatively correlated with the target.

For example, if your neighbor chooses not\nto take a parking spot in front of your house when you are not there, you can\nbenefit, even without being aware that they took this action. These \"hidden\ngifts\" represent an interesting challenge for multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL), since assigning credit when the beneficial actions of others\nare hidden is non-trivial. Here, we study the impact of hidden gifts with a\nvery simple MARL task. In this task, agents in a grid-world environment have\nindividual doors to unlock in order to obtain individual rewards. As well, if\nall the agents unlock their door the group receives a larger collective reward.\nHowever, there is only one key for all of the doors, such that the collective\nreward can only be obtained when the agents drop the key for others after they\nuse it. Notably, there is nothing to indicate to an agent that the other agents\nhave dropped the key, thus the act of dropping the key for others is a \"hidden\ngift\". We show that several different state-of-the-art RL algorithms, including\nMARL algorithms, fail to learn how to obtain the collective reward in this\nsimple task. Interestingly, we find that independent model-free policy gradient\nagents can solve the task when we provide them with information about their own\naction history, but MARL agents still cannot solve the task with action\nhistory. Finally, we derive a correction term for these independent agents,\ninspired by learning aware approaches, which reduces the variance in learning\nand helps them to converge to collective success more reliably. These results\nshow that credit assignment in multi-agent settings can be particularly\nchallenging in the presence of \"hidden gifts\", and demonstrate that learning\nawareness in independent agents can benefit these settings."}

To address this gap, we propose an explanatory\nframework that combines information flow analysis with multi-round dialogue\nevaluation, aiming to understand the origin of social bias from the perspective\nof imbalanced internal information utilization. Specifically, we first identify\nhigh-contribution image tokens involved in the model's reasoning process for\nneutral questions via information flow analysis.

Extensive experiments reveal that LVLMs exhibit\nsystematic disparities in information usage when processing images of different\ndemographic groups, suggesting that social bias is deeply rooted in the model's\ninternal reasoning dynamics.

These\nstudies reveal various forms of implicit regularization, such as $\\ell_1$-norm\nminimizing parameters in regression and max-margin solutions in classification.\nConcurrently, empirical findings show that moderate to large learning rates\nexceeding standard stability thresholds lead to faster, albeit oscillatory,\nconvergence in the so-called Edge-of-Stability regime, and induce an implicit\nbias towards minima of low sharpness (norm of training loss Hessian). In this\nwork, we argue that a comprehensive understanding of the generalization\nperformance of gradient descent requires analyzing the interaction between\nthese various forms of implicit regularization. We empirically demonstrate that\nthe learning rate balances between low parameter norm and low sharpness of the\ntrained model. We furthermore prove for diagonal linear networks trained on a\nsimple regression task that neither implicit bias alone minimizes the\ngeneralization error.

Here, we study the impact of hidden gifts with a\nvery simple MARL task. In this task, agents in a grid-world environment have\nindividual doors to unlock in order to obtain individual rewards. As well, if\nall the agents unlock their door the group receives a larger collective reward.\nHowever, there is only one key for all of the doors, such that the collective\nreward can only be obtained when the agents drop the key for others after they\nuse it. Notably, there is nothing to indicate to an agent that the other agents\nhave dropped the key, thus the act of dropping the key for others is a \"hidden\ngift\". We show that several different state-of-the-art RL algorithms, including\nMARL algorithms, fail to learn how to obtain the collective reward in this\nsimple task. Interestingly, we find that independent model-free policy gradient\nagents can solve the task when we provide them with information about their own\naction history, but MARL agents still cannot solve the task with action\nhistory. Finally, we derive a correction term for these independent agents,\ninspired by learning aware approaches, which reduces the variance in learning\nand helps them to converge to collective success more reliably. These results\nshow that credit assignment in multi-agent settings can be particularly\nchallenging in the presence of \"hidden gifts\", and demonstrate that learning\nawareness in independent agents can benefit these settings."}

By overcoming modality and\nconnection differences, CoE provides a powerful and flexible model for\ncapturing the intricate structures of real-world complex data. In our\nframework, dedicated encoders act as domain-specific experts, each specializing\nin learning distinct relational patterns in specific semantic spaces. To\nenhance robustness and extract complementary knowledge, these experts\ncollaborate through a novel large margin mechanism supported by a tailored\noptimization strategy. Rigorous theoretical analyses guarantee the framework's\nfeasibility and stability, while extensive experiments across diverse\nbenchmarks demonstrate its superior performance and broad applicability.

While deep ensembles provide\na robust method for quantifying value uncertainty, they come with significant\ncomputational overhead. Single-model methods, while computationally favorable,\noften rely on heuristics and typically require additional propagation\nmechanisms for myopic uncertainty estimates. In this work we introduce\nuniversal value-function uncertainties (UVU), which, similar in spirit to\nrandom network distillation (RND), quantify uncertainty as squared prediction\nerrors between an online learner and a fixed, randomly initialized target\nnetwork. Unlike RND, UVU errors reflect policy-conditional value uncertainty,\nincorporating the future uncertainties any given policy may encounter. This is\ndue to the training procedure employed in UVU: the online network is trained\nusing temporal difference learning with a synthetic reward derived from the\nfixed, randomly initialized target network. We provide an extensive theoretical\nanalysis of our approach using neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory and show that\nin the limit of infinite network width, UVU errors are exactly equivalent to\nthe variance of an ensemble of independent universal value functions.\nEmpirically, we show that UVU achieves equal performance to large ensembles on\nchallenging multi-task offline RL settings, while offering simplicity and\nsubstantial computational savings."}

Classical FDR control methods (e.g., BH, q-value, and\nLocalFDR) assume independence among tests and often lead to high false\nnon-discovery rates (FNR). Although various spatial FDR control methods have\nbeen developed to improve power, they still fall short in jointly addressing\nthree major challenges in neuroimaging applications: capturing complex spatial\ndependencies, maintaining low variability in both false discovery proportion\n(FDP) and false non-discovery proportion (FNP) across replications, and\nachieving computational scalability for high-resolution data. To address these\nchallenges, we propose fcHMRF-LIS, a powerful, stable, and scalable spatial FDR\ncontrol method for voxel-wise multiple testing. It integrates the local index\nof significance (LIS)-based testing procedure with a novel fully connected\nhidden Markov random field (fcHMRF) designed to model complex spatial\nstructures using a parsimonious parameterization. We develop an efficient\nexpectation-maximization algorithm incorporating mean-field approximation, the\nConditional Random Fields as Recurrent Neural Networks (CRF-RNN) technique, and\npermutohedral lattice filtering, reducing the computational complexity from\nquadratic to linear in the number of tests. Extensive simulations demonstrate\nthat fcHMRF-LIS achieves accurate FDR control, lower FNR, reduced variability\nin FDP and FNP, and a higher number of true positives compared to existing\nmethods. Applied to an FDG-PET dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative, fcHMRF-LIS identifies neurobiologically relevant brain\nregions and offers notable advantages in computational efficiency."}

Instead, we consider\n\\emph{stationary} points of the MMD which, in contrast to points globally\nminimising the MMD, can be accurately computed. Our main theoretical\ncontribution is the (perhaps surprising) result that, for integrands in the\nassociated reproducing kernel Hilbert space, the cubature error of stationary\nMMD points vanishes \\emph{faster} than the MMD. Motivated by this\n\\emph{super-convergence} property, we consider discretised gradient flows as a\npractical strategy for computing stationary points of the MMD, presenting a\nrefined convergence analysis that establishes a novel non-asymptotic\nfinite-particle error bound, which may be of independent interest."}

Inspired by human motor control, we propose Multi-Resolution\nSkill Discovery (MRSD), an HRL framework that learns multiple skill encoders at\ndifferent temporal resolutions in parallel.

We\nevaluate MRSD on tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite and show that it\noutperforms prior state-of-the-art skill discovery and HRL methods, achieving\nfaster convergence and higher final performance.

In ABMs, agent behaviors are governed by local interactions\nand stochastic rules. However, these rules are, in general, non-differentiable,\nlimiting the use of gradient-based methods for optimization, and thus\nintegration with real-world data. We propose a novel framework to learn a\ndifferentiable surrogate of any ABM by observing its generated data. Our method\ncombines diffusion models to capture behavioral stochasticity and graph neural\nnetworks to model agent interactions. Distinct from prior surrogate approaches,\nour method introduces a fundamental shift: rather than approximating\nsystem-level outputs, it models individual agent behavior directly, preserving\nthe decentralized, bottom-up dynamics that define ABMs. We validate our\napproach on two ABMs (Schelling's segregation model and a Predator-Prey\necosystem) showing that it replicates individual-level patterns and accurately\nforecasts emergent dynamics beyond training.

Traditional machine learning approaches\noften require large, labeled datasets and extensive fine-tuning, yet remain\nopaque and difficult for domain experts to interpret or improve. In this paper,\nwe propose a transparent and data-efficient investment decision framework\npowered by memory-augmented large language models (LLMs) using in-context\nlearning (ICL). Central to our method is a natural language policy embedded\ndirectly into the LLM prompt, enabling the model to apply explicit reasoning\npatterns and allowing human experts to easily interpret, audit, and iteratively\nrefine the logic. We introduce a lightweight training process that combines\nfew-shot learning with an in-context learning loop, enabling the LLM to update\nits decision policy iteratively based on structured feedback. With only minimal\nsupervision and no gradient-based optimization, our system predicts startup\nsuccess far more accurately than existing benchmarks. It is over 20x more\nprecise than random chance, which succeeds 1.9% of the time. It is also 7.1x\nmore precise than the typical 5.6% success rate of top-tier venture capital\n(VC) firms."}
