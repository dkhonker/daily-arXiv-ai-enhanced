Many existing secure SemCom approaches rely on restrictive or\nimpractical assumptions, such as favorable channel conditions for the\nlegitimate user or prior knowledge of the eavesdropper's model. To address\nthese limitations, this paper proposes a novel secure SemCom framework for\nimage transmission over wiretap channels, leveraging differential privacy (DP)\nto provide approximate privacy guarantees. Specifically, our approach first\nextracts disentangled semantic representations from source images using\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) inversion method, and then selectively\nperturbs private semantic representations with approximate DP noise. Distinct\nfrom conventional DP-based protection methods, we introduce DP noise with\nlearnable pattern, instead of traditional white Gaussian or Laplace noise,\nachieved through adversarial training of neural networks (NNs). This design\nmitigates the inherent non-invertibility of DP while effectively protecting\nprivate information. Moreover, it enables explicitly controllable security\nlevels by adjusting the privacy budget according to specific security\nrequirements, which is not achieved in most existing secure SemCom approaches.\nExperimental results demonstrate that, compared with the previous DP-based\nmethod and direct transmission, the proposed method significantly degrades the\nreconstruction quality for the eavesdropper, while introducing only slight\ndegradation in task performance.
