Although state-of-the-art\nlong-context VLMs can process around 1000 input frames, they still struggle to\neffectively leverage this sequence length, and succumb to irrelevant\ndistractors within the context window. We present Temporal Chain of Thought, an\ninference strategy for video question-answering that curates the model's input\ncontext. We use the VLM itself to iteratively identify and extract the most\nrelevant frames from the video, which are then used for answering. We\ndemonstrate how leveraging more computation at inference-time to select the\nmost relevant context leads to improvements in accuracy, in agreement with\nrecent work on inference-time scaling of LLMs. Moreover, we achieve\nstate-of-the-art results on 4 diverse video question-answering datasets,\nshowing consistent improvements with 3 different VLMs. In particular, our\nmethod shines on longer videos which would not otherwise fit within the model's\ncontext window: On longer videos of more than 1 hour on LVBench, our approach\nusing a context window of 32K outperforms the same VLM using standard inference\nwith a 700K context window by 2.8 points."}

Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these\nAI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and\nimportant topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within\nmachine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to\nresample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates\nvary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the\ntraining set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and\nseemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using\ndata obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label\nbias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and\nmedicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,\nemails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,\ndoctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support\nrigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data\nfrom audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and\nevaluate automated hiring algorithms.

As a\nbaseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained\nfrom scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While\neffective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational\noverhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment\n(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a\ndrift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of\ndrifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number\nof up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new\ndistribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while\nreducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.\n  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants\nof standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and\nTiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted\nrepresentations.

On each day $t \\le T$ an\nalgorithm must output an interval $I_t \\subseteq [0, 1]$, then a point $y_t \\in\n[0, 1]$ is revealed. The goal of the algorithm is to achieve coverage, that is,\n$y_t \\in I_t$ on (close to) a $(1 - \\alpha)$-fraction of days, while\nmaintaining efficiency, that is, minimizing the average volume (length) of the\nintervals played. This problem is an online analogue to the problem of\nconstructing efficient confidence intervals.\n  We study this problem over arbitrary and exchangeable (random order) input\nsequences. For exchangeable sequences, we show that it is possible to construct\nintervals that achieve coverage $(1 - \\alpha) - o(1)$, while having length\nupper bounded by the best fixed interval that achieves coverage in hindsight.\nFor arbitrary sequences however, we show that any algorithm that achieves a\n$\\mu$-approximation in average length compared to the best fixed interval\nachieving coverage in hindsight, must make a multiplicative factor more\nmistakes than $\\alpha T$, where the multiplicative factor depends on $\\mu$ and\nthe aspect ratio of the problem. Our main algorithmic result is a matching\nalgorithm that can recover all Pareto-optimal settings of $\\mu$ and number of\nmistakes. Furthermore, our algorithm is deterministic and therefore robust to\nan adaptive adversary.\n  This gap between the exchangeable and arbitrary settings is in contrast to\nthe classical online learning problem. In fact, we show that no single\nalgorithm can simultaneously be Pareto-optimal for arbitrary sequences and\noptimal for exchangeable sequences. On the algorithmic side, we give an\nalgorithm that achieves the near-optimal tradeoff between the two cases."}

L-VAE can be considered as an extension of \\b{eta}-VAE, wherein\nthe hyperparameter, \\b{eta}, is empirically adjusted. L-VAE mitigates the\nlimitations of \\b{eta}-VAE by learning the relative weights of the terms in the\nloss function to control the dynamic trade-off between disentanglement and\nreconstruction losses. In the proposed model, the weight of the loss terms and\nthe parameters of the model architecture are learned concurrently. An\nadditional regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent bias\ntowards either reconstruction or disentanglement losses. Experimental analyses\nshow that the proposed L-VAE finds an effective balance between reconstruction\nfidelity and disentangling the latent dimensions. Comparisons of the proposed\nL-VAE against \\b{eta}-VAE, VAE, ControlVAE, DynamicVAE, and {\\sigma}-VAE on\ndatasets, such as dSprites, MPI3D-complex, Falcor3D, and Isaac3D reveals that\nL-VAE consistently provides the best or the second best performances measured\nby a set of disentanglement metrics. Moreover, qualitative experiments on\nCelebA dataset, confirm the success of the L-VAE model for disentangling the\nfacial attributes."}
