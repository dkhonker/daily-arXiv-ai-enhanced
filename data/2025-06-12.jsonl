We propose the Adaptive Intervention\nMechanism (AIM), a novel robot-gated IIL algorithm that learns an adaptive\ncriterion for requesting human demonstrations. AIM utilizes a proxy Q-function\nto mimic the human intervention rule and adjusts intervention requests based on\nthe alignment between agent and human actions. By assigning high Q-values when\nthe agent deviates from the expert and decreasing these values as the agent\nbecomes proficient, the proxy Q-function enables the agent to assess the\nreal-time alignment with the expert and request assistance when needed. Our\nexpert-in-the-loop experiments reveal that AIM significantly reduces expert\nmonitoring efforts in both continuous and discrete control tasks.

This is problematic because it leads to poor exploration on\nreasoning problems and to unengaging, repetitive conversational agents. To\naddress this we propose Intent Factored Generation (IFG), factorising the\nsampling process into two stages. First, we sample a semantically dense intent,\ne.g., a summary or keywords. Second, we sample the final response conditioning\non both the original prompt and the intent from the first stage. This allows us\nto use a higher temperature during the intent step to promote conceptual\ndiversity, and a lower temperature during the final generation to ensure the\noutputs are coherent and self-consistent. Additionally, we find that prompting\nthe model to explicitly state its intent for each step of the chain-of-thought\nbefore generating the step is beneficial for reasoning tasks. We demonstrate\nour method's effectiveness across a diverse set of tasks. We show this method\nimproves both pass@k and Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Feedback on maths\nand code tasks. For instruction-tuning, we combine IFG with Direct Preference\nOptimisation to increase conversational diversity without sacrificing reward.\nFinally, we achieve higher diversity while maintaining the quality of\ngenerations on a general language modelling task, using a new dataset of reader\ncomments and news articles that we collect and open-source. In summary, we\npresent a simple method of increasing the sample diversity of LLMs while\nmaintaining performance. This method can be implemented by changing the prompt\nand varying the temperature during generation, making it easy to integrate into\nmany algorithms for gains across various applications."}

The network, trained with a large number of datasets, learns to extract\nthe statistical properties of the datasets and can localize feature shifts from\npreviously unseen datasets and shifts without the need for re-training.

This position paper questions\nwhether this approach is the right path forward, as these autonomous systems\nstill have problems with reliability, transparency, and understanding the\nactual requirements of human. We suggest a different approach: LLM-based\nHuman-Agent Systems (LLM-HAS), where AI works with humans rather than replacing\nthem. By keeping human involved to provide guidance, answer questions, and\nmaintain control, these systems can be more trustworthy and adaptable. Looking\nat examples from healthcare, finance, and software development, we show how\nhuman-AI teamwork can handle complex tasks better than AI working alone. We\nalso discuss the challenges of building these collaborative systems and offer\npractical solutions.

Inspired by these findings and fascinating phenomena\nemerging in the over-parameterized regime, we examine a parallel direction: do\nsimilar scaling laws govern predictive uncertainties in deep learning? In\nidentifiable parametric models, such scaling laws can be derived in a\nstraightforward manner by treating model parameters in a Bayesian way. In this\ncase, for example, we obtain $O(1/N)$ contraction rates for epistemic\nuncertainty with respect to the number of data $N$. However, in\nover-parameterized models, these guarantees do not hold, leading to largely\nunexplored behaviors. In this work, we empirically show the existence of\nscaling laws associated with various measures of predictive uncertainty with\nrespect to dataset and model sizes. Through experiments on vision and language\ntasks, we observe such scaling laws for in- and out-of-distribution predictive\nuncertainty estimated through popular approximate Bayesian inference and\nensemble methods. Besides the elegance of scaling laws and the practical\nutility of extrapolating uncertainties to larger data or models, this work\nprovides strong evidence to dispel recurring skepticism against Bayesian\napproaches: \"In many applications of deep learning we have so much data\navailable: what do we need Bayes for?\". Our findings show that \"so much data\"\nis typically not enough to make epistemic uncertainty negligible."}

Current methods\nfor increasing diversity often only operate at the token-level, paraphrasing\nthe same response. This is problematic because it leads to poor exploration on\nreasoning problems and to unengaging, repetitive conversational agents. To\naddress this we propose Intent Factored Generation (IFG), factorising the\nsampling process into two stages. First, we sample a semantically dense intent,\ne.g., a summary or keywords. Second, we sample the final response conditioning\non both the original prompt and the intent from the first stage. This allows us\nto use a higher temperature during the intent step to promote conceptual\ndiversity, and a lower temperature during the final generation to ensure the\noutputs are coherent and self-consistent. Additionally, we find that prompting\nthe model to explicitly state its intent for each step of the chain-of-thought\nbefore generating the step is beneficial for reasoning tasks. We demonstrate\nour method's effectiveness across a diverse set of tasks. We show this method\nimproves both pass@k and Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Feedback on maths\nand code tasks. For instruction-tuning, we combine IFG with Direct Preference\nOptimisation to increase conversational diversity without sacrificing reward.\nFinally, we achieve higher diversity while maintaining the quality of\ngenerations on a general language modelling task, using a new dataset of reader\ncomments and news articles that we collect and open-source. In summary, we\npresent a simple method of increasing the sample diversity of LLMs while\nmaintaining performance.

We explore a novel approach that\nrepresents karst networks as graphs and applies graph generative models (deep\nlearning techniques) to capture the intricate nature of karst environments. In\nthis representation, nodes retain spatial information and properties, while\nedges signify connections between nodes. Our generative process consists of two\nmain steps.
