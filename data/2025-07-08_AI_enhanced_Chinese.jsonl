This paper proposes a lightweight detection unit, or watchdog mechanism,\ndesigned to act as a pre-filter that determines when to activate a long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) model. This mechanism reduces the volume of input fed\nto the LSTM model, limiting it to instances that are more likely to involve\nenergy theft thereby preserving detection accuracy while substantially reducing\nenergy consumption associated with continuous model execution. The proposed\nsystem was evaluated through simulations across six scenarios with varying\ntheft severity and number of active thieves. Results indicate a power\nconsumption reduction exceeding 64\\%, with minimal loss in detection accuracy\nand consistently high recall. These findings support the feasibility of a more\nenergy-efficient and scalable approach to energy theft detection in smart\ngrids. In contrast to prior work that increases model complexity to achieve\nmarginal accuracy gains, this study emphasizes practical deployment\nconsiderations such as inference efficiency and system scalability. The results\nhighlight the potential for deploying sustainable, AI-assisted monitoring\nsystems within modern smart grid infrastructures.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper presents a watchdog mechanism that acts as a pre-filter for an LSTM model to detect energy theft more efficiently.

However, this binary approach\nconflates token/operation redundancy - critical operations may be removed along\nwith discarded tokens, while preserved tokens retain all potentially redundant\noperations. To surgically eliminate redundant operations while preserving\ncritical ones, we propose Greedily Sorted Operation Pruning (GSOP), a\ndata-driven method that directly prunes operations rather than tokens. GSOP\nfirst decomposes a VLM decoder's computations into atomic operations along\nthree dimensions: token groups, layer positions, and computation modules. GSOP\ndetermines the pruning order of operations through greedy sorting: GSOP\niteratively selects the redundant operation that incurs minimal performance\ndrop considering previously pruned operations. Different computational budgets\ncan be accommodated without re-searching by simply pruning operations according\nto this order until the desired budget is met. GSOP enhances sorting efficiency\nthrough: a) leveraging historical operation rankings to avoid redundant\nevaluations; b) excluding the ``free-to-prune\" and ``danger-to-prune\"\noperations from sorting. GSOP achieves compelling efficiency-performance\ntradeoffs, reducing computation by 70% with only 4% performance loss while\nmaintaining up to 18% higher performance than state-of-the-art methods when\ntransferred across diverse VLMs and tasks.

In this study, we present the first large-scale security analysis of\nLLM-generated patches using 20,000+ issues from the SWE-bench dataset.

We also assess the security of patches generated by\nthree top-performing agentic frameworks (OpenHands, AutoCodeRover, HoneyComb)\non a subset of our data. Finally, we analyze a wide range of code, issue, and\nproject-level factors to understand the conditions under which LLMs and agents\nare most likely to generate insecure code. Our findings reveal that the\nstandalone LLM introduces nearly 9x more new vulnerabilities than developers,\nwith many of these exhibiting unique patterns not found in developers' code.\nAgentic workflows also generate a significant number of vulnerabilities,\nparticularly when granting LLMs more autonomy, potentially increasing the\nlikelihood of misinterpreting project context or task requirements. We find\nthat vulnerabilities are more likely to occur in LLM patches associated with a\nhigher number of files, more lines of generated code, and GitHub issues that\nlack specific code snippets or information about the expected code behavior and\nsteps to reproduce.

The Rust\ncompiler is unable to statically enforce Rust principles in mixed Rust code\nwhich can lead to many security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose\nCapsLock, a security enforcement mechanism that can run at the level of machine\ncode and detect Rust principle violations at run-time in mixed code. CapsLock\nis kept simple enough to be implemented into recent capability-based hardware\nabstractions that provide low-cost spatial memory safety. CapsLock introduces a\nnovel revoke-on-use abstraction for capability-based designs, wherein accessing\na memory object via a capability implicitly invalidates certain other\ncapabilities pointing to it, thereby also providing temporal memory safety\nautomatically, without requiring software to explicitly specify such\ninvalidation. Thus, CapsLock is the first mechanism capable of providing\ncross-language enforcement of Rust principles. We implemented a prototype of\nCapsLock on QEMU. Evaluation results show that CapsLock is highly compatible\nwith existing Rust code (passing 99.7% of the built-in test cases of the 100\nmost popular crates) and flags Rust principle violations in real-world Rust\nprojects that use FFI or inline assembly.

However, the concepts are\nfrequently conflated or insufficiently distinguished in academic and policy\ndiscourse, undermining efforts to design or evaluate systems that should remain\nunder meaningful human supervision.\n  This paper undertakes a targeted critical review of literature on supervision\noutside of AI, along with a brief summary of past work on the topic related to\nAI. We then differentiate control as being ex-ante or real-time, and\noperational rather than policy or governance. In contrast, oversight is either\na policy and governance function, or is ex-post. We suggest that control aims\nto prevent failures. In contrast, oversight often focuses on detection,\nremediation, or incentives for future prevention; all preventative oversight\nstrategies nonetheless necessitate control.\n  Building on this foundation, we make three contributions. First, we propose a\ntheoretically-informed yet policy-grounded framework that articulates the\nconditions under which each mechanism is possible, where they fall short, and\nwhat is required to make them meaningful in practice. Second, we outline how\nsupervision methods should be documented and integrated into risk management,\nand drawing on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model, we outline a\nmaturity model for AI supervision. Third, we explicitly highlight some\nboundaries of these mechanisms, including where they apply, where they fail,\nand where it is clear that no existing methods suffice.

Two models are typically\nconsidered: the one-pass model, which outputs results only at the end of the\nstream, and the continual observation model, which requires releasing private\nsummaries at every time step. While the one-pass model allows more efficient\nsolutions, continual observation better reflects scenarios where timely and\nongoing insights are critical.\n  In the one-pass setting, sketches have proven to be an effective tool for\ndifferentially private frequency analysis, as they can be privatized by a\nsingle injection of calibrated noise.

While\nOperators significantly simplify DevOps workflows, they introduce new security\nrisks. In particular, Kubernetes enforces namespace isolation to separate\nworkloads and limit user access, ensuring that users can only interact with\nresources within their authorized namespaces. However, Kubernetes Operators\noften demand elevated privileges and may interact with resources across\nmultiple namespaces. This introduces a new class of vulnerabilities, the\nCross-Namespace Reference Vulnerability. The root cause lies in the mismatch\nbetween the declared scope of resources and the implemented scope of the\nOperator logic, resulting in Kubernetes being unable to properly isolate the\nnamespace. Leveraging such vulnerability, an adversary with limited access to a\nsingle authorized namespace may exploit the Operator to perform operations\naffecting other unauthorized namespaces, causing Privilege Escalation and\nfurther impacts. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to\nsystematically investigate the security vulnerability of Kubernetes Operators.\nWe present Cross-Namespace Reference Vulnerability with two strategies,\ndemonstrating how an attacker can bypass namespace isolation.

However, consulting an LLM does not have to be a single turn\nactivity.

In\nthis paper, we examine the use of agent-based architecture to bolster LLM-based\nQuestion-Answering systems with additional reasoning capabilities. We examine\nthe automatic resolution of potential incompleteness or ambiguities in\nquestions by transducers implemented using LLM-based agents. We focus on\nseveral benchmark datasets that are known to contain questions with these\ndeficiencies to varying degrees. We equip different LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo and\nLlama-4-Scout) with agents that act as specialists in detecting and resolving\ndeficiencies of incompleteness and ambiguity. The agents are implemented as\nzero-shot ReAct agents. Rather than producing an answer in a single step, the\nmodel now decides between 3 actions a) classify b) resolve c) answer. Action a)\ndecides if the question is incomplete, ambiguous, or normal. Action b)\ndetermines if any deficiencies identified can be resolved. Action c) answers\nthe resolved form of the question. We compare the use of LLMs with and without\nthe use of agents with these components.

However, we\nreveal that there is no free lunch for this improved efficiency: data\ndependency and an implicit conflict between auditing and utility impair the\ntightness of the auditing results. Addressing these challenges, our key\ninsights include reducing data dependency through uncorrelated data and\nresolving the auditing-utility conflict by decoupling the criteria for\neffective auditing and separating objectives for utility and auditing. We first\npropose a unified framework, UniAud, for data-independent auditing that\nmaximizes auditing power through a novel uncorrelated canary construction and a\nself-comparison framework. We then extend this framework as UniAud++ for\ndata-dependent auditing, optimizing the auditing and utility trade-off through\nmulti-task learning with separate objectives for auditing and training.\nExperimental results validate that our black-box O(1) framework matches the\nstate-of-the-art auditing results of O(T) auditing with thousands of runs,\ndemonstrating the best efficiency-auditing trade-off across vision and language\ntasks.

To address this, it is essential for LLMs not only to produce\nanswers but also to provide accurate estimates of their correctness.\nUncertainty quantification methods have been introduced to assess the quality\nof LLM outputs, with factual accuracy being a key aspect of that quality. Among\nthese methods, those that leverage hidden states to train probes have shown\nparticular promise, as these internal representations encode information\nrelevant to the factuality of responses, making this approach the focus of this\npaper. However, the probe trained on the hidden states of one dataset often\nstruggles to generalise to another dataset of a different task or domain. To\naddress this limitation, we explore combining data-agnostic features with\nhidden-state features and assess whether this hybrid feature set enhances\nout-of-domain performance. We further examine whether selecting only the most\ninformative hidden-state features, thereby discarding task-specific noise,\nenables the data-agnostic features to contribute more effectively. The\nexperiment results indicate that although introducing data-agnostic features\ngenerally enhances generalisation performance in most cases, in certain\nscenarios their inclusion degrades performance.

The former treats all temporal information of each variable as\na token, focusing on capturing local temporal features of individual variables,\nwhile the latter constructs a token from the multivariate information at each\ntime step, emphasizing the modeling of global temporal dependencies. Current\nmainstream models are mostly based on Transformer and the emerging Mamba.\nTransformers excel at modeling global dependencies through self-attention\nmechanisms but exhibit limited sensitivity to local temporal patterns and\nsuffer from quadratic computational complexity, restricting their efficiency in\nlong-sequence processing. In contrast, Mamba, based on state space models\n(SSMs), achieves linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling but\nstruggles to aggregate global contextual information in parallel. To overcome\nthe limitations of both models, we propose DC-Mamber, a dual-channel\nforecasting model based on Mamba and linear Transformer for time series\nforecasting. Specifically, the Mamba-based channel employs a\nchannel-independent strategy to extract intra-variable features, while the\nTransformer-based channel adopts a channel-mixing strategy to model\ncross-timestep global dependencies. DC-Mamber first maps the raw input into two\ndistinct feature representations via separate embedding layers. These\nrepresentations are then processed by a variable encoder (built on Mamba) and a\ntemporal encoder (built on linear Transformer), respectively.

Through kernelized sparse regression and structural\nconstraints, ReTimeCausal iteratively refines missing values (E-step) and\ncausal graphs (M-step), resolving cross-frequency dependencies and missing data\nissues.

Neuroscience theory suggests\nthat mammals evolved flexible intelligence through the replication of a\nsemi-independent, sensorimotor module, a functional unit known as a cortical\ncolumn. To address the disparity between biological and artificial\nintelligence, thousand-brains systems were proposed as a means of mirroring the\narchitecture of cortical columns and their interactions.\n  In the current work, we evaluate the unique properties of Monty, the first\nimplementation of a thousand-brains system. We focus on 3D object perception,\nand in particular, the combined task of object recognition and pose estimation.\nUtilizing the YCB dataset of household objects, we first assess Monty's use of\nsensorimotor learning to build structured representations, finding that these\nenable robust generalization. These representations include an emphasis on\nclassifying objects by their global shape, as well as a natural ability to\ndetect object symmetries. We then explore Monty's use of model-free and\nmodel-based policies to enable rapid inference by supporting principled\nmovements.

However, these\nrationales are often overly verbose, even for simple problems, leading to\nwasted context, increased latency, and higher energy consumption. We observe\nthat verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct\nregions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and\ninjecting a \"steering vector\" to transition between these modes, we can\nreliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively\ncompressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as\nActivation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens\nreasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we\nprovide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution,\nderived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate\nsteering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC\nachieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets,\nwhile maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models. As a\ntraining-free method, ASC introduces negligible runtime overhead and, on\nMATH500, delivers an average 2.73x speedup in end-to-end reasoning wall-clock\ntime on an 8B model.

To address\nthese issues, this paper proposes the Simplified Graph Neural Tangent Kernel\n(SGTK), which replaces the traditional multi-layer stacking mechanism with a\ncontinuous $K$-step aggregation operation. This novel approach streamlines the\niterative kernel computation process, effectively eliminating redundant\ncalculations while preserving the kernel's expressiveness.

This allows kernel values to be directly determined from the\nexpected outputs of activation functions in the infinite-width regime,\nbypassing the need for explicit layer-by-layer computation. SGNK further\nreduces computational complexity while maintaining the capacity to capture\nintricate structural patterns in graphs.

The identification, annotation and explanation of anomalous\nomics-based patients or individuals may become crucial to better reshape the\ndisease, e.g., by detecting early onsets signaled by the omics and undetectable\nfrom observable symptoms. Here, we developed MLASDO (Machine Learning based\nAnomalous Sample Detection on Omics), a new method and software tool to\nidentify, characterize and automatically describe anomalous samples based on\nomics data. Its workflow is based on three steps: (1) classification of healthy\nand cases individuals using a support vector machine algorithm; (2) detection\nof anomalous samples within groups; (3) explanation of anomalous individuals\nbased on clinical data and expert knowledge. We showcase MLASDO using\ntranscriptomics data of 317 healthy controls (HC) and 465 Parkinson's disease\n(PD) cases from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. In this cohort,\nMLASDO detected 15 anomalous HC with a PD-like transcriptomic signature and\nPD-like clinical features, including a lower proportion of CD4/CD8 naive\nT-cells and CD4 memory T-cells compared to HC (P<3.5*10^-3). MLASDO also\nidentified 22 anomalous PD cases with a transcriptomic signature more similar\nto that of HC and some clinical features more similar to HC, including a lower\nproportion of mature neutrophils compared to PD cases (P<6*10^-3). In summary,\nMLASDO is a powerful tool that can help the clinician to detect and explain\nanomalous HC and cases of interest to be followed up.

While neural operator frameworks, such as Deep Operator Networks\n(DeepONets), have shown considerable success in single-physics settings, their\nextension to multiphysics problems remains poorly understood. In particular,\nthe challenge of learning nonlinear interactions between tightly coupled\nphysical fields has received little systematic attention. This study addresses\na foundational question: should the architectural design of a neural operator\nreflect the strength of physical coupling it aims to model? To answer this, we\npresent the first comprehensive, architecture-aware evaluation of DeepONet\nvariants across three regimes: single-physics, weakly coupled, and strongly\ncoupled multiphysics systems. We consider a reaction-diffusion equation with\ndual spatial inputs, a nonlinear thermo-electrical problem with bidirectional\ncoupling through temperature-dependent conductivity, and a viscoplastic\nthermo-mechanical model of steel solidification governed by transient\nphase-driven interactions.

A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that\nshed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we\nintroduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art\ncosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours\nand generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of\nits kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter\nhalos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand\ndirected trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time\nscales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict\ncosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the\nvelocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions,\nand to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time\nscales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established\napproaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning.\nFor the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that\nare minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more\ncomputationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural\nnetworks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features\nsometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far\nlonger training times. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve\nthese baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit\nthe data.

Business angels offer a\ncritical source of funding, but their decision-making is often subjective and\nresource-intensive for both investor and entrepreneur.

One such tool, the Critical Factor Assessment (CFA), deployed more\nthan 20,000 times by the Canadian Innovation Centre, has been evaluated\npost-decision and found to be significantly more accurate than investors' own\ndecisions.

In this research, we\nprompted multiple large language models (LLMs) to assign the eight CFA factors\nto a dataset of 600 transcribed, unstructured startup pitches seeking business\nangel funding with known investment outcomes.

We\nvalidate the framework on three PDE-driven dynamical systems - stress evolution\nin heterogeneous microstructures, Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion, and\nplanetary-scale shallow water system - demonstrating consistent reduction in\nerror accumulation over time compared to individual models. Critically, the\nmethod requires only a few time steps as input, enabling full trajectory\npredictions with inference times significantly faster than numerical solvers.\nOur results highlight the robustness of ensemble methods in diverse physical\nsystems and their potential as efficient and accurate alternatives to\ntraditional solvers.

In the absence of effective treatment options, early\ndiagnosis is crucial for initiating management strategies to delay disease\nonset and slow down its progression. In this study, we propose Retformer, a\nnovel transformer-based architecture for detecting AD using retinal imaging\nmodalities, leveraging the power of transformers and explainable artificial\nintelligence. The Retformer model is trained on datasets of different\nmodalities of retinal images from patients with AD and age-matched healthy\ncontrols, enabling it to learn complex patterns and relationships between image\nfeatures and disease diagnosis.

However, existing benchmarks\npredominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's\ncapability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is\ncrucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the\nfirst comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction\nprediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality,\nmulti-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818\ninteractions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and\nleakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two\ncomplementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess\nintra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented\ntasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and\nessential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's\ncapability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein\nfunction annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism\nanalysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories,\nconsisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language\nmodel-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI\nmodels have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional\nproperties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world\nbiological applications.

Existing methods address\nstructural isolation by degrading graph learning models to MLPs for cold-start\ninference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However,\nthis results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further\nchallenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose\nNeighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer\nframework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a\nself-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention\nmask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a \"student\"\nprediction based only on self-information (i.e., the node's own features), and\na \"teacher\" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This\nenables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby\nfully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To\nhandle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a\none-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature\ndata into token sequences, which are then processed by a Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion.\nExperimental results on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior\nperformance on multimodal cold-start node classification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NTSFormer\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u56feTransformer\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u8282\u70b9\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8282\u70b9\u662f\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\uff08\u5373\u6ca1\u6709\u8fb9\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5e38\u5e38\u6709\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u7f3a\u5c11\u6587\u672c\u6216\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u964d\u7ea7\u4e3aMLP\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bbf\u95ee\u56fe\uff09\u6765\u6307\u5bfcMLP\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5f53\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u52a0\u5267\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u56feTransformer\u6846\u67b6NTSFormer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6559\u8303\u5f0f\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u9694\u79bb\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0cNTSFormer\u4f7f\u7528\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u6ce8\u610f\u63a9\u7801\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u540c\u65f6\u505a\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\uff1a\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u6211\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u201c\u5b66\u751f\u201d\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u81ea\u6211\u548c\u90bb\u5c45\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u201c\u6559\u5e08\u201d\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cNTSFormer\u6267\u884c\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4ee4\u724c\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7531\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\uff08MoE\uff09\u8f93\u5165\u6295\u5f71\u548cTransformer\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cNTSFormer\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "NTSFormer\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}
