AdaReasoner is trained using a reinforcement learning (RL)\nframework, combining a factorized action space with a targeted exploration\nstrategy, along with a pretrained reward model to optimize the policy model for\nreasoning configurations with only a few-shot guide. AdaReasoner is backed by\ntheoretical guarantees and experiments of fast convergence and a sublinear\npolicy gap. Across six different LLMs and a variety of reasoning tasks, it\nconsistently outperforms standard baselines, preserves out-of-distribution\nrobustness, and yield gains on knowledge-intensive tasks through tailored\nprompts."}

However, core\ncognitive faculties of human intelligence, such as abstract reasoning and\ngeneralization, remain underexplored. To address this, we evaluate recent\nreasoning-oriented LLMs on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)\nbenchmark, which explicitly demands both faculties. We formulate ARC as a\nprogram synthesis task and propose nine candidate solvers. Experimental results\nshow that repeated-sampling planning-aided code generation (RSPC) achieves the\nhighest test accuracy and demonstrates consistent generalization across most\nLLMs. To further improve performance, we introduce an ARC solver, Knowledge\nAugmentation for Abstract Reasoning (KAAR), which encodes core knowledge priors\nwithin an ontology that classifies priors into three hierarchical levels based\non their dependencies. KAAR progressively expands LLM reasoning capacity by\ngradually augmenting priors at each level, and invokes RSPC to generate\ncandidate solutions after each augmentation stage. This stage-wise reasoning\nreduces interference from irrelevant priors and improves LLM performance.\nEmpirical results show that KAAR maintains strong generalization and\nconsistently outperforms non-augmented RSPC across all evaluated LLMs,\nachieving around 5% absolute gains and up to 64.52% relative improvement.\nDespite these achievements, ARC remains a challenging benchmark for\nreasoning-oriented LLMs, highlighting future avenues of progress in LLMs."}

Through extensive experiments and theoretical\nanalysis, we identify two distinct timescales: an early time\n$\\tau_\\mathrm{gen}$ at which models begin to generate high-quality samples, and\na later time $\\tau_\\mathrm{mem}$ beyond which memorization emerges. Crucially,\nwe find that $\\tau_\\mathrm{mem}$ increases linearly with the training set size\n$n$, while $\\tau_\\mathrm{gen}$ remains constant. This creates a growing window\nof training times with $n$ where models generalize effectively, despite showing\nstrong memorization if training continues beyond it. It is only when $n$\nbecomes larger than a model-dependent threshold that overfitting disappears at\ninfinite training times.

During standard safety tests on a mainstream large\nreasoning model, we unexpectedly observe that the model without any contextual\ncues would occasionally recognize it is being evaluated and hence behave more\nsafety-aligned. This motivates us to conduct a systematic study on the\nphenomenon of evaluation faking, i.e., an AI system autonomously alters its\nbehavior upon recognizing the presence of an evaluation context and thereby\ninfluencing the evaluation results. Through extensive experiments on a diverse\nset of foundation models with mainstream safety benchmarks, we reach the main\nfinding termed the observer effects for AI: When the AI system under evaluation\nis more advanced in reasoning and situational awareness, the evaluation faking\nbehavior becomes more ubiquitous, which reflects in the following aspects: 1)\nReasoning models recognize evaluation 16% more often than non-reasoning models.\n2) Scaling foundation models (32B to 671B) increases faking by over 30% in some\ncases, while smaller models show negligible faking. 3) AI with basic memory is\n2.3x more likely to recognize evaluation and scores 19% higher on safety tests\n(vs. no memory).

Minimizing the Wasserstein-2 distance (W2), which captures geometric\nchanges, and providing a spectral view of dynamics are essential for\nlong-horizon forecasting. Our model, FRIREN (Flow-inspired Representations via\nInterpretable Eigen-networks), implements an augmented normalizing-flow block\nthat embeds data into a normally distributed latent representation.

This enables practitioners\nto identify which modes grow, decay, or oscillate, both locally and\nsystem-wide. FRIREN achieves an MSE of 11.4, MAE of 1.6, and SWD of 0.96 on\nLorenz-63 in a 336-in, 336-out, dt=0.01 setting, surpassing TimeMixer (MSE\n27.3, MAE 2.8, SWD 2.1).

Record an agent's interaction trace with\nits environment and internal decision process during task execution, 2.\nSummarize this trace into a structured \"experience\" encapsulating the workflow\nand constraints, and 3. Replay these experiences in subsequent similar tasks to\nguide the agent's behavior. We detail a multi-level experience abstraction\nmethod and a check function mechanism in AgentRR: the former balances\nexperience specificity and generality, while the latter serves as a trust\nanchor to ensure completeness and safety during replay. In addition, we explore\nmultiple application modes of AgentRR, including user-recorded task\ndemonstration, large-small model collaboration and privacy-aware agent\nexecution, and envision an experience repository for sharing and reusing\nknowledge to further reduce deployment cost."}

By providing the intervention data\nfrom one LLM to another, we show that this improvement is partly a result of\nengaging in the process of generating effective interventions, paralleling\nresults in the literature on human learning. Further analysis reveals that\nengaging in intervention can help LLMs escape from two common failure modes:\novercomplication, where the LLM falsely assumes prior knowledge about the\nblack-box, and overlooking, where the LLM fails to incorporate observations.\nThese insights provide practical guidance for helping LLMs more effectively\nreverse-engineer black-box systems, supporting their use in making new\ndiscoveries."}

In sequential decision\nmaking, a user's preference can be a preorder over possible outcomes, each of\nwhich is a temporal sequence of events. This paper considers a class of\npreference inference problems where the user's unknown preference is\nrepresented by a preorder over regular languages (sets of temporal sequences),\nreferred to as temporal goals. Given a finite set of pairwise comparisons\nbetween finite words, the objective is to learn both the set of temporal goals\nand the preorder over these goals. We first show that a preference relation\nover temporal goals can be modeled by a Preference Deterministic Finite\nAutomaton (PDFA), which is a deterministic finite automaton augmented with a\npreorder over acceptance conditions. The problem of preference inference\nreduces to learning the PDFA. This problem is shown to be computationally\nchallenging, with the problem of determining whether there exists a PDFA of\nsize smaller than a given integer $k$, consistent with the sample, being\nNP-Complete. We formalize the properties of characteristic samples and develop\nan algorithm that guarantees to learn, given a characteristic sample, the\nminimal PDFA equivalent to the true PDFA from which the sample is drawn. We\npresent the method through a running example and provide detailed analysis\nusing a robotic motion planning problem."}

DCMs play a central role in applied econometrics by enabling\ninference on key economic variables, such as marginal rates of substitution,\nrather than focusing solely on predicting choices on new unlabeled data.\nHowever, while traditional DCMs offer high interpretability and support for\npoint and interval estimation of economic quantities, these models often\nunderperform in predictive tasks compared to deep learning (DL) models. Despite\ntheir predictive advantages, DL models remain largely underutilized in discrete\nchoice due to concerns about their lack of interpretability, unstable parameter\nestimates, and the absence of established methods for uncertainty\nquantification. Here, we introduce a deep learning model architecture\nspecifically designed to integrate with approximate Bayesian inference methods,\nsuch as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD). Our proposed model\ncollapses to behaviorally informed hypotheses when data is limited, mitigating\noverfitting and instability in underspecified settings while retaining the\nflexibility to capture complex nonlinear relationships when sufficient data is\navailable. We demonstrate our approach using SGLD through a Monte Carlo\nsimulation study, evaluating both predictive metrics--such as out-of-sample\nbalanced accuracy--and inferential metrics--such as empirical coverage for\nmarginal rates of substitution interval estimates. Additionally, we present\nresults from two empirical case studies: one using revealed mode choice data in\nNYC, and the other based on the widely used Swiss train choice stated\npreference data."}

However, such rule-based 0/1\noutcome reward methods lack the capability to regulate the intermediate\nreasoning processes during chain-of-thought (CoT) generation, leading to severe\noverthinking phenomena. In response, recent studies have designed reward\nfunctions to reinforce models' behaviors in producing shorter yet correct\ncompletions. Nevertheless, we observe that these length-penalty reward\nfunctions exacerbate RL training instability: as the completion length\ndecreases, model accuracy abruptly collapses, often occurring early in\ntraining. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective solution\nGRPO-$\\lambda$, an efficient and stabilized variant of GRPO, which dynamically\nadjusts the reward strategy by monitoring the correctness ratio among\ncompletions within each query-sampled group. A low correctness ratio indicates\nthe need to avoid length penalty that compromises CoT quality, triggering a\nswitch to length-agnostic 0/1 rewards that prioritize reasoning capability. A\nhigh ratio maintains length penalties to boost efficiency. Experimental results\nshow that our approach avoids training instability caused by length penalty\nwhile maintaining the optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off. On the GSM8K,\nGPQA, MATH-500, AMC 2023, and AIME 2024 benchmarks, it improves average\naccuracy by 1.48% while reducing CoT sequence length by 47.3%."}

We study optimal-policy learning under interference on a dynamic\nnetwork. Existing approaches to this problem require repeated observations of\nthe same fixed network and struggle to scale in sample size beyond as few as\nfifteen connected units -- both limit applications. We show that under common\nassumptions on the structure of interference, rewards become linear. This\nenables us to develop a scalable Thompson sampling algorithm that maximizes\npolicy impact when a new $n$-node network is observed each round. We prove a\nBayesian regret bound that is sublinear in $n$ and the number of rounds.\nSimulation experiments show that our algorithm learns quickly and outperforms\nexisting methods.

Existing works\nhave been exploring LLMs to collect trajectories for imitation learning or to\noffer reward signals for online RL training. However, the Outcome Reward Model\n(ORM) used in existing works cannot provide finegrained feedback and can\nover-penalize the valuable steps in finally failed trajectories. To this end,\nwe propose Progress Reward Model (ProgRM) to provide dense informative\nintermediate rewards by predicting a task completion progress for each step in\nonline training. To handle the challenge of progress reward label annotation,\nwe further design an efficient LCS-based (Longest Common Subsequence)\nself-annotation algorithm to discover the key steps in trajectories and assign\nprogress labels accordingly. ProgRM is evaluated with extensive experiments and\nanalyses. Actors trained with ProgRM outperform leading proprietary LLMs and\nORM-trained actors, illustrating the effectiveness of ProgRM.

In this work, we expose a vulnerability in prevalent\ntool/function-calling protocols by investigating a series of edits to tool\ndescriptions, some of which can drastically increase a tool's usage from LLMs\nwhen competing with alternatives. Through controlled experiments, we show that\ntools with properly edited descriptions receive over 10 times more usage from\nGPT-4.1 and Qwen2.5-7B than tools with original descriptions.
