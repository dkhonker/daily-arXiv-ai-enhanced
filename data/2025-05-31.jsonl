The second approach, on the other hand, relies heavily on\nfull-precision latent weights for gradient approximation of binary weights,\nwhich not only remains suboptimal but also introduces substantial complexity.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel framework that effectively transforms LLMs\ninto multi-kernel Boolean parameters, for the first time, finetunes them\ndirectly in the Boolean domain, eliminating the need for expensive latent\nweights.

We\npresent a mathematical framework that models jobs, workers, and worker-job fit,\nintroducing a novel decomposition of skills into decision-level and\naction-level subskills to reflect the complementary strengths of humans and\nGenAI. We analyze how changes in subskill abilities affect job success,\nidentifying conditions for sharp transitions in success probability. We also\nestablish sufficient conditions under which combining workers with\ncomplementary subskills significantly outperforms relying on a single worker.\nThis explains phenomena such as productivity compression, where GenAI\nassistance yields larger gains for lower-skilled workers. We demonstrate the\nframework' s practicality using data from O*NET and Big-Bench Lite, aligning\nreal-world data with our model via subskill-division methods.

In this case, their\nlearned score overfits the finite dataset so that the reverse-time SDE samples\nare mostly training points. In this paper, we interpret the empirical score as\na noisy version of the true score and show that its covariance matrix is\nasymptotically a re-weighted data PCA. In large dimension, the small time limit\nmakes the noise variance blow up while simultaneously reducing spatial\ncorrelation. To reduce this variance, we introduce a kernel-smoothed empirical\nscore and analyze its bias-variance trade-off. We derive asymptotic bounds on\nthe Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true distribution and the one\ngenerated by the modified reverse SDE. Regularization on the score has the same\neffect as increasing the size of the training dataset, and thus helps prevent\nmemorization. A spectral decomposition of the forward diffusion suggests better\nvariance control under some regularity conditions of the true data\ndistribution. Reverse diffusion with kernel-smoothed empirical score can be\nreformulated as a gradient descent drifted toward a Log-Exponential\nDouble-Kernel Density Estimator (LED-KDE). This perspective highlights two\nregularization mechanisms taking place in denoising diffusions: an initial\nGaussian kernel first diffuses mass isotropically in the ambient space, while a\nsecond kernel applied in score space concentrates and spreads that mass along\nthe data manifold. Hence, even a straightforward regularization-without any\nlearning-already mitigates memorization and enhances generalization.\nNumerically, we illustrate our results with several experiments on synthetic\nand MNIST datasets."}

Here, we take inspiration from neuromodulation and propose to learn\nweights which are smoothly parameterized functions of task context variables.\nRather than optimize a weight vector, i.e. a single point in weight space, we\noptimize a smooth manifold in weight space with a predefined topology. To\naccomplish this, we derive a formal treatment of optimization of manifolds as\nthe minimization of a loss functional subject to a constraint on volumetric\nmovement, analogous to gradient descent. During inference, conditioning selects\na single point on this manifold which serves as the effective weight matrix for\na particular sub-task. This strategy for conditioning has two main advantages.\nFirst, the topology of the manifold (whether a line, circle, or torus) is a\nconvenient lever for inductive biases about the relationship between tasks.\nSecond, learning in one state smoothly affects the entire manifold, encouraging\ngeneralization across states. To verify this, we train manifolds with several\ntopologies, including straight lines in weight space (for conditioning on e.g.\nnoise level in input data) and ellipses (for rotated images).

Recent studies have leveraged the power of\ndesigned LoRA initialization, to enhance the fine-tuning efficiency, or to\npreserve knowledge in the pre-trained LLM. However, none of these works can\naddress the two cases at the same time. To this end, we introduce\nSubspace-Constrained LoRA (SC-LoRA), a novel LoRA initialization framework\nengineered to navigate the trade-off between efficient fine-tuning and\nknowledge preservation. We achieve this by constraining the output of trainable\nLoRA adapters in a low-rank subspace, where the context information of\nfine-tuning data is most preserved while the context information of preserved\nknowledge is least retained, in a balanced way. Such constraint enables the\ntrainable weights to primarily focus on the main features of fine-tuning data\nwhile avoiding damaging the preserved knowledge features.

We show that\npreference-based M-estimators achieve a better asymptotic variance than\nsample-only M-estimators, further improved by deterministic preferences.\nLeveraging the hard constraints revealed by deterministic preferences, we\npropose an estimator achieving an estimation error scaling of\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ -- a significant improvement over the $\\Theta(1/\\sqrt{n})$\nrate attainable with samples alone. Next, we establish a lower bound that\nmatches this accelerated rate; up to dimension and problem-dependent constants.\nWhile the assumptions underpinning our analysis are restrictive, they are\nsatisfied by notable cases such as Gaussian or Laplace distributions for\npreferences based on the log-probability reward."}

As a potential mitigation, we\ninvestigate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring, wherein a weaker trusted monitor\nmodel continuously oversees the intermediate reasoning steps of a more powerful\nbut untrusted model. We compare CoT monitoring to action-only monitoring, where\nonly final outputs are reviewed, in a red-teaming setup where the untrusted\nmodel is instructed to pursue harmful side tasks while completing a coding\nproblem. We find that CoT monitoring improves detection by up to 27 percentage\npoints in scenarios where action-only monitoring fails to reliably identify\nsabotage. However, CoT traces can also contain misleading rationalizations that\ndeceive the monitor, reducing performance in more obvious sabotage cases. To\naddress this, we introduce a hybrid protocol that independently scores both\nreasoning and final outputs and combines them using a weighted average. This\nhybrid monitor consistently outperforms both CoT and action-only monitors\nacross all tested models and tasks, with detection rates over four times higher\nthan action-only monitoring for subtle deception scenarios."}

A central\nchallenge in these systems is the presence of multiplicative noise, commonly\nknown as speckle, which degrades image quality. Despite the widespread use of\ncoherent imaging systems, their theoretical foundations remain relatively\nunderexplored. In this paper, we study both the theoretical and algorithmic\naspects of likelihood-based approaches for multilook coherent imaging,\nproviding a rigorous framework for analysis and method development. Our\ntheoretical contributions include establishing the first theoretical upper\nbound on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the maximum likelihood estimator under\nthe deep image prior hypothesis. Our results capture the dependence of MSE on\nthe number of parameters in the deep image prior, the number of looks, the\nsignal dimension, and the number of measurements per look. On the algorithmic\nside, we employ projected gradient descent (PGD) as an efficient method for\ncomputing the maximum likelihood solution. Furthermore, we introduce two key\nideas to enhance the practical performance of PGD. First, we incorporate the\nNewton-Schulz algorithm to compute matrix inverses within the PGD iterations,\nsignificantly reducing computational complexity. Second, we develop a bagging\nstrategy to mitigate projection errors introduced during PGD updates. We\ndemonstrate that combining these techniques with PGD yields state-of-the-art\nperformance.

We are interested in minimizing the KL divergence between the\ntrue distribution and the algorithm's estimate. We first construct minimax\noptimal private estimators. Minimax optimality however fails to shed light on\nan algorithm's performance on individual (non-worst-case) instances $p$ and\nsimple minimax-optimal DP estimators can have poor empirical performance on\nreal distributions. We then study this problem from an instance-optimality\nviewpoint, where the algorithm's error on $p$ is compared to the minimum\nachievable estimation error over a small local neighborhood of $p$. Under\nnatural notions of local neighborhood, we propose algorithms that achieve\ninstance-optimality up to constant factors, with and without a differential\nprivacy constraint. Our upper bounds rely on (private) variants of the\nGood-Turing estimator. Our lower bounds use additive local neighborhoods that\nmore precisely captures the hardness of distribution estimation in KL\ndivergence, compared to ones considered in prior works."}

However, most commonly used optimizers treat these matrix parameters\nas flattened vectors during optimization, potentially overlooking their\ninherent structural properties. Recently, an optimizer called Muon has been\nproposed, specifically designed to optimize matrix-structured parameters.\nExtensive empirical evidence shows that Muon can significantly outperform\ntraditional optimizers when training neural networks. Nonetheless, the\ntheoretical understanding of Muon's convergence behavior and the reasons behind\nits superior performance remain limited. In this work, we present a\ncomprehensive convergence rate analysis of Muon and its comparison with\nGradient Descent (GD). We further characterize the conditions under which Muon\ncan outperform GD. Our theoretical results reveal that Muon can benefit from\nthe low-rank and approximate blockwise diagonal structure of Hessian matrices\n-- phenomena widely observed in practical neural network training. Our\nexperimental results support and corroborate the theoretical findings."}
