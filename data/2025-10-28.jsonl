Using multi-source and heterogeneous IoT data aids in providing\nefficient data analytics for a variety of prevalent and crucial applications.\nTo address the privacy and security concerns raised by analyzing IoT data\nlocally or in the cloud, distributed data analytics techniques were proposed to\ncollect and analyze data in edge or fog devices. In this context, federated\nlearning has been recommended as an ideal distributed machine/deep\nlearning-based technique for edge/fog computing environments. Additionally, the\ndata analytics results are time-sensitive; they should be generated with\nminimal latency and high reliability. As a result, reusing efficient\narchitectures validated through a high number of challenging test cases would\nbe advantageous. The work proposed here presents a solution using a\nmicroservices-based architecture that allows an IoT application to be\nstructured as a collection of fine-grained, loosely coupled, and reusable\nentities. The proposed solution uses the promising capabilities of federated\nlearning to provide intelligent microservices that ensure efficient, flexible,\nand extensible data analytics. This solution aims to deliver cloud calculations\nto the edge to reduce latency and bandwidth congestion while protecting the\nprivacy of exchanged data. The proposed approach was validated through an\nIoT-malware detection and classification use case. MaleVis, a publicly\navailable dataset, was used in the experiments to analyze and validate the\nproposed approach. This dataset included more than 14,000 RGB-converted images,\ncomprising 25 malware classes and one benign class.

In QIF there are two main perspectives\nfor the quantification of leakage.

On the other hand, the dynamic perspective considers only a\nspecific, concrete run of the system that has been realised, while ignoring all\nother runs. The dynamic perspective is relevant for, e.g., system monitors and\ntrackers, especially when deciding whether to continue or to abort a particular\nrun based on how much leakage has occurred up to a certain point. Although the\nstatic perspective of leakage is well-developed in the literature, the dynamic\nperspective still lacks the same level of theoretical maturity. In this paper\nwe take steps towards bridging this gap with the following key contributions:\n(i) we provide a novel definition of dynamic leakage that decouples the\nadversary's belief about the secret value from a baseline distribution on\nsecrets against which the success of the attack is measured; (ii) we\ndemonstrate that our formalisation satisfies relevant information-theoretic\naxioms, including non-interference and relaxed versions of monotonicity and the\ndata-processing inequality (DPI); (iii) we identify under what kind of analysis\nstrong versions of the axioms of monotonicity and the DPI might not hold, and\nexplain the implications of this (perhaps counter-intuitive) outcome; (iv) we\nshow that our definition of dynamic leakage is compatible with the\nwell-established static perspective; and (v) we exemplify the use of our\ndefinition on the formalisation of attacks against privacy-preserving data\nreleases."}

One\nstrategy is to introduce benign assumptions about users and scenarios to\njustify fulfilling harmful requests. For instance, an RLM reasons that harmful\nrequests like ``outline a strategy for stealing customers' credit card\ninformation from a retail store'' could be associated with the benign intent of\n``a security professional trying to test defense,'' despite no such benign\ncontext being provided as input. We observe that many open-weight RLMs,\nincluding DeepSeek-R1-distilled, s1.1, Phi-4-mini-reasoning, and Nemotron,\nsuffer from self-jailbreaking despite being aware of the harmfulness of the\nrequests. We also provide a mechanistic understanding of self-jailbreaking:\nRLMs are more compliant after benign reasoning training, and after\nself-jailbreaking, models appear to perceive malicious requests as less harmful\nin the CoT, thus enabling compliance with them.

However, the common\npractice of protecting model parameters from theft attacks by storing them in\nan encrypted format and decrypting them at runtime introduces significant\ncomputational overhead, thus undermining the core principles of in-memory\ncomputing, which aim to integrate computation and storage. This paper presents\na robust strategy for protecting BNN model parameters, particularly within\nin-memory computing frameworks. Our method utilizes a secret key derived from a\nphysical unclonable function to transform model parameters prior to storage in\nthe crossbar. Subsequently, the inference operations are performed on the\nencrypted weights, achieving a very special case of Fully Homomorphic\nEncryption (FHE) with minimal runtime overhead. Our analysis reveals that\ninference conducted without the secret key results in drastically diminished\nperformance, with accuracy falling below 15%. These results validate the\neffectiveness of our protection strategy in securing BNNs within in-memory\ncomputing architectures while preserving computational efficiency."}

Prevailing password\nguessing models primarily emphasize patterns derived from leaked passwords,\nwhile neglecting these external influences -- a limitation that hampers their\nadaptability to emerging password trends and erodes their effectiveness over\ntime.\n  To address these challenges, we propose KAPG, a knowledge-augmented password\nguessing framework that adaptively integrates external lexical knowledge into\nthe guessing process. KAPG couples internal statistical knowledge learned from\nleaked passwords with external information that reflects real-world trends. By\nusing password prefixes as anchors for knowledge lookup, it dynamically injects\nrelevant external cues during generation while preserving the structural\nregularities of authentic passwords.

Many existing secure SemCom approaches rely on restrictive or\nimpractical assumptions, such as favorable channel conditions for the\nlegitimate user or prior knowledge of the eavesdropper's model. To address\nthese limitations, this paper proposes a novel secure SemCom framework for\nimage transmission over wiretap channels, leveraging differential privacy (DP)\nto provide approximate privacy guarantees. Specifically, our approach first\nextracts disentangled semantic representations from source images using\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) inversion method, and then selectively\nperturbs private semantic representations with approximate DP noise. Distinct\nfrom conventional DP-based protection methods, we introduce DP noise with\nlearnable pattern, instead of traditional white Gaussian or Laplace noise,\nachieved through adversarial training of neural networks (NNs). This design\nmitigates the inherent non-invertibility of DP while effectively protecting\nprivate information. Moreover, it enables explicitly controllable security\nlevels by adjusting the privacy budget according to specific security\nrequirements, which is not achieved in most existing secure SemCom approaches.\nExperimental results demonstrate that, compared with the previous DP-based\nmethod and direct transmission, the proposed method significantly degrades the\nreconstruction quality for the eavesdropper, while introducing only slight\ndegradation in task performance.
