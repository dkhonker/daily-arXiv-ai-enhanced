Recent work has explored this phenomenon\nin the context of neural networks, where the loss function is invariant under\ncolumn and row permutations of the network weights. It has been observed that\nlocal minima exhibit significant symmetry with respect to the network weights\n(invariance to row and column permutations). And moreover no critical point was\nfound that lacked symmetry. We extend this line of inquiry by investigating\nsymmetry phenomena in real-valued loss functions defined on a broader class of\nspaces. We will introduce four more cases: the projective case over a finite\nfield, the octahedral graph case, the perfect matching case, and the particle\nattraction case. We show that as in the neural network case, all the critical\npoints observed have non-trivial symmetry. Finally we introduce a new measure\nof symmetry in the system and show that it reveals additional symmetry\nstructures not captured by the previous measure."}

However, this comes at the cost of\nsignificant computational overhead. In this paper, we show that a substantial\nportion of this overhead can be avoided by skipping uninformative prompts\nbefore rollout. Our analysis of reward dynamics reveals a strong temporal\nconsistency in prompt value: prompts that are uninformative in one epoch of\ntraining are likely to remain uninformative in future epochs. Based on these\ninsights, we propose GRESO (GRPO with Efficient Selective Rollout), an online,\nlightweight pre-rollout filtering algorithm that predicts and skips\nuninformative prompts using reward training dynamics. By evaluating GRESO on a\nbroad range of math reasoning benchmarks and models, such as Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and Qwen2.5-Math-7B, we show that GRESO achieves\nup to 2.4x wall-clock time speedup in rollout and up to 2.0x speedup in total\ntraining time without accuracy degradation."}

For this problem, various robust bounded\naggregation (RBA) rules have been proposed at the central server to mitigate\nthe impact of Byzantine attacks. However, current DL methods apply RBA rules\nfor the local gradients from the honest devices and the disruptive information\nfrom Byzantine devices, and the learning performance degrades significantly\nwhen the local gradients of different devices vary considerably from each\nother. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new DL method to cope with\nByzantine attacks based on coded robust aggregation (CRA-DL). Before training\nbegins, the training data are allocated to the devices redundantly. During\ntraining, in each iteration, the honest devices transmit coded gradients to the\nserver computed from the allocated training data, and the server then\naggregates the information received from both honest and Byzantine devices\nusing RBA rules. In this way, the global gradient can be approximately\nrecovered at the server to update the global model. Compared with current DL\nmethods applying RBA rules, the improvement of CRA-DL is attributed to the fact\nthat the coded gradients sent by the honest devices are closer to each other.\nThis closeness enhances the robustness of the aggregation against Byzantine\nattacks, since Byzantine messages tend to be significantly different from those\nof honest devices in this case. We theoretically analyze the convergence\nperformance of CRA-DL.

A widely adopted\nstrategy to detect hallucination, known as self-assessment, relies on the\nmodel's own output confidence to estimate the factual accuracy of its answers.\nHowever, this strategy assumes that the model's output distribution closely\nreflects the true data distribution, which may not always hold in practice. As\nbias accumulates through the model's layers, the final output can diverge from\nthe underlying reasoning process, making output-level confidence an unreliable\nsignal for hallucination detection. In this work, we propose Sample-Specific\nPrompting (SSP), a new framework that improves self-assessment by analyzing\nperturbation sensitivity at intermediate representations. These\nrepresentations, being less influenced by model bias, offer a more faithful\nview of the model's latent reasoning process. Specifically, SSP dynamically\ngenerates noise prompts for each input and employs a lightweight encoder to\namplify the changes in representations caused by the perturbation. A\ncontrastive distance metric is then used to quantify these differences and\nseparate truthful from hallucinated responses. By leveraging the dynamic\nbehavior of intermediate representations under perturbation, SSP enables more\nreliable self-assessment.

The semantic\nspace of natural language is structurally misaligned with the high-dimensional\nvector spaces in which LLMs operate, resulting in information loss and\nbehavioral drift. Beyond surface-level inefficiencies, we highlight a deeper\narchitectural limitation: current LLMs were not trained with the objective of\nsupporting agentic behavior.

The standard\nnext-token prediction paradigm fails to support the structural alignment\nrequired for robust, scalable agent coordination.

We start with a\nhigh-fidelity digital model of an air vehicle. Instead of using this model to\ngenerate a point prediction, we use a machine learning method to produce a\nreduced-order model (ROM). The ROM has two important properties. First, it can\ngenerate a prediction based on any set of conditions the pilot flies. Second,\nif the test result at those conditions differ from the prediction, the ROM can\nbe updated using the new data. The outcome of flight test is thus a refined ROM\nat whatever conditions were flown. This ROM in turn updates and validates the\nhigh-fidelity model. We present a single example of this \"point-less\"\narchitecture, using T-38C flight test data. We first use a generic aircraft\nmodel to build a ROM of longitudinal pitching motion as a hypersurface. We then\ningest unconstrained flight test data and use Gaussian Process Regression to\nupdate and condition the hypersurface. By proposing a second-order equivalent\nsystem for the T-38C, this hypersurface then generates parameters necessary to\nassess MIL-STD-1797B compliance for longitudinal dynamics."}

Catastrophic\nforgetting refers to the poor performance on retention of a previously learned\ntask when a new task is being learned.

However, the very existence of databands and\ntolerances is the problem more fundamental than inadequate pilot skill. We\npropose a novel approach, which eliminates test points. We start with a\nhigh-fidelity digital model of an air vehicle. Instead of using this model to\ngenerate a point prediction, we use a machine learning method to produce a\nreduced-order model (ROM). The ROM has two important properties. First, it can\ngenerate a prediction based on any set of conditions the pilot flies. Second,\nif the test result at those conditions differ from the prediction, the ROM can\nbe updated using the new data. The outcome of flight test is thus a refined ROM\nat whatever conditions were flown. This ROM in turn updates and validates the\nhigh-fidelity model.

However, a notable gap remains\nin the literature: the exact exponential rate at which the error probability\napproaches zero has yet to be established, even in the relatively simple\nsetting of $K$-armed bandits with Gaussian noise. In this paper, we address\nthis gap by examining the problem within the context of linear bandits. We\nintroduce a novel algorithm for best feasible arm identification that\nguarantees an exponential decay in the error probability. Remarkably, the decay\nrate -- characterized by the exponent -- matches the theoretical lower bound\nderived using information-theoretic principles. Our approach leverages a\nposterior sampling framework embedded within a game-based sampling rule\ninvolving a min-learner and a max-learner. This strategy shares its foundations\nwith Thompson sampling, but is specifically tailored to optimize the\nidentification process under fixed-budget constraints. Furthermore, we validate\nthe effectiveness of our algorithm through comprehensive empirical evaluations\nacross various problem instances with different levels of complexity.

To overcome this limitation, this work introduces a novel\nmulti-task learning method driven by knowledge distillation (MTL-KD), which\nenables the efficient training of heavy decoder models with strong\ngeneralization ability. The proposed MTL-KD method transfers policy knowledge\nfrom multiple distinct RL-based single-task models to a single heavy decoder\nmodel, facilitating label-free training and effectively improving the model's\ngeneralization ability across diverse tasks. In addition, we introduce a\nflexible inference strategy termed Random Reordering Re-Construction (R3C),\nwhich is specifically adapted for diverse VRP tasks and further boosts the\nperformance of the multi-task model. Experimental results on 6 seen and 10\nunseen VRP variants with up to 1000 nodes indicate that our proposed method\nconsistently achieves superior performance on both uniform and real-world\nbenchmarks, demonstrating robust generalization abilities."}

We further show that whether a\nfunction class admits non-asymptotic length generalization is equivalent to the\ndecidability of its language equivalence problem, which implies that there is\nno computable upper bound for the length complexity of Context-Free Grammars.\nOn the positive side, we show that the length complexity of Deterministic\nFinite Automata is $2n - 2$ where $n$ is the number of states of the\nground-truth automaton. Our main results are upper bounds of length complexity\nfor a subset of a transformer-related function class called C-RASP (Yang &\nChiang, 2024). We show that the length complexity of 1-layer C-RASP functions\nis $O(T^2)$ when the ground-truth function has precision $T$, and that the\nlength complexity of 2-layer C-RASP functions is $O(T^{O(K)})$ when the\nground-truth function has precision $T$ and $K$ heads."}

However, recent work has demonstrated phenomenology of model\nrepresentations that lies outside the scope of this hypothesis, showing\nsignatures of hierarchical, nonlinear, and multi-dimensional features. This\nraises the question: do SAEs represent features that possess structure at odds\nwith their motivating hypothesis? If not, does avoiding this mismatch help\nidentify said features and gain further insights into neural network\nrepresentations? To answer these questions, we take a construction-based\napproach and re-contextualize the popular matching pursuits (MP) algorithm from\nsparse coding to design MP-SAE -- an SAE that unrolls its encoder into a\nsequence of residual-guided steps, allowing it to capture hierarchical and\nnonlinearly accessible features. Comparing this architecture with existing SAEs\non a mixture of synthetic and natural data settings, we show: (i) hierarchical\nconcepts induce conditionally orthogonal features, which existing SAEs are\nunable to faithfully capture, and (ii) the nonlinear encoding step of MP-SAE\nrecovers highly meaningful features, helping us unravel shared structure in the\nseemingly dichotomous representation spaces of different modalities in a\nvision-language model, hence demonstrating the assumption that useful features\nare solely linearly accessible is insufficient.

In the shuffled testing\nsetting, testing power is lost due to the misalignment/shuffling of vertices\nacross graphs, and we demonstrate the capacity of OmniMatch to correct for\nmisaligned vertices prior to testing and hence recover the lost testing power.\nWe further demonstrate the algorithm on a pair of data examples from\nconnectomics and machine translation."}

We propose dynamics\nmodelling (DyMo), a method that augments LLMs with a state prediction\ncapability alongside function calling during post-training. This enables LLMs\nto predict the future states of their actions through an internal environment\nmodel. On the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard V2, DyMo improves success\nrates and significantly reduces hallucinations. We further integrate the\ninternal environment model into self-verification sampling (SVS), and show that\nthis substantially improves pass^k over number of trials k, and allows the\nmodel to refuse unreliable outputs. Together, DyMo and SVS greatly enhance the\neffectiveness and reliability of LLMs for tool use.

This paper\nintroduces a novel reflective multi-agent method designed to address these\nchallenges in the context of legally compliant persuasion. Our approach employs\nspecialized agents--a Factor Analyst and an Argument Polisher--in an iterative\nrefinement process to generate 3-ply legal arguments (plaintiff, defendant,\nrebuttal). We evaluate Reflective Multi-Agent against single-agent,\nenhanced-prompt single-agent, and non-reflective multi-agent baselines using\nfour diverse LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Maverick-17b-128e,\nLlama-4-Scout-17b-16e) across three legal scenarios: \"arguable\", \"mismatched\",\nand \"non-arguable\". Results demonstrate Reflective Multi-Agent's significant\nsuperiority in successful abstention (preventing generation when arguments\ncannot be grounded), marked improvements in hallucination accuracy (reducing\nfabricated and misattributed factors), particularly in \"non-arguable\"\nscenarios, and enhanced factor utilization recall (improving the use of\nprovided case facts). These findings suggest that structured reflection within\na multi-agent framework offers a robust computable method for fostering ethical\npersuasion and mitigating manipulation in LLM-based legal argumentation\nsystems, a critical step towards trustworthy AI in law.

Originating from psychometrics, adaptive testing has\nbecome the mainstream method for human measurement and has now been widely\napplied in education, healthcare, sports, and sociology. It customizes\nassessments by selecting the fewest test questions . However, current adaptive\ntesting methods face several challenges. The mechanized nature of most\nalgorithms leads to guessing behavior and difficulties with open-ended\nquestions. Additionally, subjective assessments suffer from noisy response data\nand coarse-grained test outputs, further limiting their effectiveness. To move\ncloser to an ideal adaptive testing process, we propose TestAgent, a large\nlanguage model (LLM)-powered agent designed to enhance adaptive testing through\ninteractive engagement. This is the first application of LLMs in adaptive\ntesting. TestAgent supports personalized question selection, captures\ntest-takers' responses and anomalies, and provides precise outcomes through\ndynamic, conversational interactions.

However, the\npredictive importance of these variables may not represent their causal\nrelationships with diseases. This paper uses clinical variables from a heart\nfailure (HF) patient cohort to investigate the causal explainability of\nimportant variables obtained in statistical and ML contexts. Due to inherent\nregression modeling, popular causal discovery methods strictly assume that the\ncause and effect variables are numerical and continuous. This paper proposes a\nnew computational framework to enable causal structure discovery (CSD) and\nscore the causal strength of mixed-type (categorical, numerical, binary)\nclinical variables for binary disease outcomes. In HF classification, we\ninvestigate the association between the importance rank order of three feature\ntypes: correlated features, features important for ML predictions, and causal\nfeatures. Our results demonstrate that CSD modeling for nonlinear causal\nrelationships is more meaningful than its linear counterparts. Feature\nimportance obtained from nonlinear classifiers (e.g., gradient-boosting trees)\nstrongly correlates with the causal strength of variables without\ndifferentiating cause and effect variables. Correlated variables can be causal\nfor HF, but they are rarely identified as effect variables.
