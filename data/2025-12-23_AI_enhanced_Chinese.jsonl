For Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (RMLLMs), this is uniquely challenging: intermediate chain-of-thought steps can still leak sensitive information even when final answers are forgotten, and overly aggressive interventions easily damage general reasoning ability. Yet no benchmark jointly evaluates how well unlearning methods suppress reasoning-level leakage while preserving reasoning competence. We address this gap with RMLLMU-Bench, the first benchmark for RMLLM unlearning that extends standard forgetting metrics with dedicated measures of reasoning leakage and reasoning retention. A systematic evaluation on RMLLMU-Bench reveals that existing unlearning methods for MLLMs and Large (Language) Reasoning Models (LRMs) either leave substantial leakage in the reasoning process or severely degrade reasoning performance. To address these gaps, we propose R-MUSE (Reasoning-preserving MLLM Unlearning via Subspace guidance and Adaptive Steering), a training-free and inference-time intervention framework that steers internal representations to forget both answers and reasoning traces while explicitly preserving general reasoning.

A central challenge in this setting is question answering, which requires jointly leveraging unstructured text and the structured relational signals within the graph.

Retrieval-augmented generation methods that operate purely on text often treat passages as isolated units, ignoring the interconnected structure of the graph. Conversely, graph-based RAG methods that serialize large subgraphs into long textual sequences quickly become infeasible due to LLM context-length constraints, resulting in fragmented reasoning and degraded accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Graph-O1, an agentic GraphRAG framework that enables LLMs to conduct stepwise, interactive reasoning over graphs.

We aim to explore a more practical and underexplored scenario, continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) for text understanding, which involves a sequence of testing (unobserved) domains in testing. Current CTTA methods struggle in reducing error accumulation over domains and enhancing generalization to handle unobserved domains: 1) Noise-filtering reduces accumulated errors but discards useful information, and 2) accumulating historical domains enhances generalization, but it is hard to achieve adaptive accumulation. In this paper, we propose a CTTA-T (continual test-time adaptation for text understanding) framework adaptable to evolving target domains: it adopts a teacher-student framework, where the teacher is domain-aware and generalized for evolving domains. To improve teacher predictions, we propose a refine-then-filter based on dropout-driven consistency, which calibrates predictions and removes unreliable guidance. For the adaptation-generalization trade-off, we construct a domain-aware teacher by dynamically accumulating cross-domain semantics via incremental PCA, which continuously tracks domain shifts.

To better understand and mitigate this trade-off, we conduct a comprehensive study of reasoning strategies for reasoning models in RAG multi-hop QA tasks.

Monitoring the chain-of-thought (CoT) of today's reasoning models has proven effective for detecting misbehavior. However, this \"monitorability\" may be fragile under different training procedures, data sources, or even continued system scaling. To measure and track monitorability, we propose three evaluation archetypes (intervention, process, and outcome-property) and a new monitorability metric, and introduce a broad evaluation suite. We demonstrate that these evaluations can catch simple model organisms trained to have obfuscated CoTs, and that CoT monitoring is more effective than action-only monitoring in practical settings. We compare the monitorability of various frontier models and find that most models are fairly, but not perfectly, monitorable. We also evaluate how monitorability scales with inference-time compute, reinforcement learning optimization, and pre-training model size. We find that longer CoTs are generally more monitorable and that RL optimization does not materially decrease monitorability even at the current frontier scale. Notably, we find that for a model at a low reasoning effort, we could instead deploy a smaller model at a higher reasoning effort (thereby matching capabilities) and obtain a higher monitorability, albeit at a higher overall inference compute cost. We further investigate agent-monitor scaling trends and find that scaling a weak monitor's test-time compute when monitoring a strong agent increases monitorability. Giving the weak monitor access to CoT not only improves monitorability, but it steepens the monitor's test-time compute to monitorability scaling trend.

Purpose. To design and experimentally validate an architecture in which class concepts are formed from a handful of examples (5 - 6 per class) through structural and parametric reductions, providing transparent decisions and eliminating backpropagation.

Contour vectorization is followed by constructing a bipartite graph (Point/Line as nodes) with normalized geometric attributes such as coordinates, length, angle, and direction; reductions include the elimination of unstable substructures or noise and the alignment of paths between critical points. Concepts are formed by iterative composition of samples, and classification is performed by selecting the best graph-to-concept match (using approximated GED). Results. On an MNIST subset with 5 - 6 base examples per class (single epoch), we obtain a consistent accuracy of around 82% with full traceability of decisions: misclassifications can be explained by explicit structural similarities.

Results on real-world breast cancer imaging data using a pathological complete response prediction model shows that all multi-center schemes outperform centralized monitoring, with F1-score improvements up to 10.3% in drift detection.

We propose that chunking mechanisms play an essential role and show how the CogAct computational model grounds concept learning in fundamental cognitive processes and structures (such as chunking, attention, STM and LTM). First are the in-principle demonstrations, with CogAct automatically adapting to learn a range of categories from simple logical functions, to artificial categories, to natural raw (as opposed to natural pre-processed) concepts in the dissimilar domains of literature, chess and music. This kind of adaptive learning is difficult for most other psychological models, e.g., with cognitive models stopping at modelling artificial categories and (non-GPT) models based on deep learning requiring task-specific changes to the architecture. Secondly, we offer novel ways of designing human benchmarks for concept learning experiments and simulations accounting for subjectivity, ways to control for individual human experiences, all while keeping to real-life complex categories. We ground CogAct in simulations of subjective conceptual spaces of individual human participants, capturing humans subjective judgements in music, with the models learning from raw music score data without bootstrapping to pre-built knowledge structures.

Experience, whether externally observed or internally simulated, is represented as vectors relative to a current conceptual subspace. Residual components capture systematic representational failure, and candidate conceptual extensions are restricted to low-rank, admissible transformations.

Internally generated counterfactual representations contribute to learning only insofar as they expose or amplify structured residual error, and cannot introduce arbitrary novelty.

While existing jailbreak studies explore both single-turn and multi-turn strategies, most implicitly assume a static safety boundary and fail to account for how contextual interactions dynamically influence model behavior, leading to limited stability and generalization. Motivated by this gap, we propose MEEA (Mere Exposure Effect Attack), a psychology-inspired, fully automated black-box framework for evaluating multi-turn safety robustness, grounded in the mere exposure effect. MEEA leverages repeated low-toxicity semantic exposure to induce a gradual shift in a model's effective safety threshold, enabling progressive erosion of alignment constraints over sustained interactions. Concretely, MEEA constructs semantically progressive prompt chains and optimizes them using a simulated annealing strategy guided by semantic similarity, toxicity, and jailbreak effectiveness. Extensive experiments on both closed-source and open-source models, including GPT-4, Claude-3.5, and DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate that MEEA consistently achieves higher attack success rates than seven representative baselines, with an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) improvement exceeding 20%. Ablation studies further validate the necessity of both annealing-based optimization and contextual exposure mechanisms. Beyond improved attack effectiveness, our findings indicate that LLM safety behavior is inherently dynamic and history-dependent, challenging the common assumption of static alignment boundaries and highlighting the need for interaction-aware safety evaluation and defense mechanisms.

In AI interpretability, reports of similar ''dead salmon'' artifacts abound: feature attribution, probing, sparse auto-encoding, and even causal analyses can produce plausible-looking explanations for randomly initialized neural networks. In this work, we examine this phenomenon and argue for a pragmatic statistical-causal reframing: explanations of computational systems should be treated as parameters of a (statistical) model, inferred from computational traces. This perspective goes beyond simply measuring statistical variability of explanations due to finite sampling of input data; interpretability methods become statistical estimators, and findings should be tested against explicit and meaningful alternative computational hypotheses, with uncertainty quantified with respect to the postulated statistical model. It also highlights important theoretical issues, such as the identifiability of common interpretability queries, which we argue is critical to understand the field's susceptibility to false discoveries, poor generalizability, and high variance.

Existing studies mainly focus on evaluating reasoning chains from a functional perspective, with little attention paid to their structural mechanisms.

The purpose is not to test knowledge of Rock-Paper-Scissors itself, but to probe whether the model can exhibit mind-like reasoning about sequential behavior. To support systematic evaluation, we provide a benchmark consisting of both static strategies and lightweight dynamic strategies specified by well-prompted rules.

In this study, we investigate if human and LLM ratings of the features of stigmas, along with prompt style and type of stigma, have effect on bias towards stigmatized groups in LLM outputs. We measure bias against 93 stigmatized groups across three widely used LLMs (Granite 3.0-8B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B) using SocialStigmaQA, a benchmark that includes 37 social scenarios about stigmatized identities; for example deciding wether to recommend them for an internship.

The problem of generalization has been addressed formally in classical planning where provable correct policies that generalize over all instances of a given domain have been learned using combinatorial methods. The aim of this work is to bring these two research threads together to illuminate the conditions under which (deep) reinforcement learning approaches, and in particular, policy optimization methods, can be used to learn policies that generalize like combinatorial methods do. We draw on lessons learned from previous combinatorial and deep learning approaches, and extend them in a convenient way. From the former, we model policies as state transition classifiers, as (ground) actions are not general and change from instance to instance. From the latter, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) adapted to deal with relational structures for representing value functions over planning states, and in our case, policies. With these ingredients in place, we find that actor-critic methods can be used to learn policies that generalize almost as well as those obtained using combinatorial approaches while avoiding the scalability bottleneck and the use of feature pools. Moreover, the limitations of the DRL methods on the benchmarks considered have little to do with deep learning or reinforcement learning algorithms, and result from the well-understood expressive limitations of GNNs, and the tradeoff between optimality and generalization (general policies cannot be optimal in some domains).

To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoTrail-GUI, a novel framework designed to mimic human-like experiential learning by equipping agents with a dynamic, accessible memory.

First, during Experience Exploration, an agent autonomously interacts with GUI environments to build a curated database of successful task trajectories, validated by a reward model.

Second, in the Memory Injection stage, upon receiving a new task, our system efficiently retrieves the most relevant past trajectories to serve as actionable ''memories''. Finally, during GUI Task Inference, these memories are injected as in-context guidance to inform the agent's reasoning and decision-making process.

The current standard for evaluating this capability is MedCalc-Bench, a large-scale dataset constructed using LLM-based feature extraction and rule-based aggregation. However, treating such model-generated benchmarks as static oracles risks enshrining historical model errors as evaluation gold standards, a problem dangerously amplified when these datasets serve as reward signals for Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this work, we propose viewing benchmarks for complex tasks such as clinical score computation as ''in-progress living documents'' that should be periodically re-evaluated as the processes for creating them improve. We introduce a systematic, physician-in-the-loop pipeline that leverages advanced agentic verifiers to audit and relabel MedCalc-Bench, utilizing automated triage to reserve scarce clinician attention for the most contentious instances. Our audit reveals that a notable fraction of original labels diverge from medical ground truth due to extraction errors, calculator logic mismatches, and clinical ambiguity. To study whether this label noise meaningfully impacts downstream RL training, we fine-tune a Qwen3-8B model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and demonstrate that training on corrected labels yields an 8.7% absolute improvement in accuracy over the original baseline -- validating that label noise materially affects model evaluation. These findings underscore that in safety-critical domains, rigorous benchmark maintenance is a prerequisite for genuine model alignment.", "AI": {"error": "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'model_dump'"}}
