Our key innovation is a LLMs-based multi-agent\nsystem orchestrating three specialized agents: Category Discovery for taxonomy\ncreation, Categorization for ticket grouping, and Knowledge Synthesis for\narticle generation. Applying our methodology to real-world support tickets with\nresolution notes and comments, our system creates a compact knowledge base -\nreducing total volume to just 3.4% of original ticket data while improving\nquality. Experiments demonstrate that our prebuilt knowledge base in RAG\nsystems significantly outperforms traditional RAG implementations (48.74% vs.\n38.60% helpful answers) and achieves a 77.4% reduction in unhelpful responses.\nBy automating institutional knowledge capture that typically remains siloed in\nexperts' heads, our solution translates to substantial operational efficiency:\nreducing support workload, accelerating resolution times, and creating\nself-improving systems that automatically resolve approximately 50% of future\nsupply chain tickets.

In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of\nproperties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function\nof several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted\nsum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction\nto a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to\ndifferent constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the\nchoice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which\nchoice is the best. We start it with simulation studies and observe an\ninteresting pattern: in most cases, the optimal estimation of the target\nproperty changes monotonically with the increase of each weight, and the best\nconfiguration of weights is often to set some weights as zero. To understand\nhow it happens, we first establish the elementary theoretical framework and\nthen provide deeper sufficient conditions for the case of two sub-properties\nand of more sub-properties respectively.

Our theoretical analysis identifies three\nprincipal factors driving the evolution: (i) the projection of gradient flows,\ninduced by the optimization dynamics, onto the operator-norm Jacobian of\nparameter matrices; (ii) the projection of gradient noise, arising from the\nrandomness in mini-batch sampling, onto the operator-norm Jacobian; and (iii)\nthe projection of the gradient noise onto the operator-norm Hessian of\nparameter matrices. Furthermore, our theoretical framework sheds light on such\nas how noisy supervision, parameter initialization, batch size, and mini-batch\nsampling trajectories, among other factors, shape the evolution of the\nLipschitz continuity of neural networks. Our experimental results demonstrate\nstrong agreement between the theoretical implications and the observed\nbehaviors."}

We systematically investigate the interaction between model\nediting and fine-tuning in the context of T2I diffusion models, which are known\nto exhibit biases and generate inappropriate content. Our study spans two T2I\nmodel families (Stable Diffusion and FLUX), two sota editing techniques, and\nthree fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, and DoRA).

DLBC partitions agents into distinct groups\nand dynamically modulates behavioral diversity both within and between these\ngroups. By dynamically modulating behavioral diversity within and between these\ngroups, DLBC achieves enhanced division of labor through inter-group\nconsistency, which constrains behavioral strategies across different groups.\nSimultaneously, intra-group consistency, achieved by aligning behavioral\nstrategies within each group, fosters stronger intra-group cooperation.\nCrucially, DLBC's direct constraint of agent policy functions ensures its broad\napplicability across various algorithmic frameworks. Experimental results in\nvarious grouping cooperation scenarios demonstrate that DLBC significantly\nenhances both intra-group cooperative performance and inter-group task\nspecialization, yielding substantial performance improvements.

To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought.

SING enables fast and reliable inference in latent SDE models by\napproximating intractable integrals and parallelizing computations in time. We\nprovide theoretical guarantees that SING will approximately optimize the\nintractable, continuous-time objective of interest. Moreover, we demonstrate\nthat better state inference enables more accurate estimation of nonlinear drift\nfunctions using, for example, Gaussian process SDE models. SING outperforms\nprior methods in state inference and drift estimation on a variety of datasets,\nincluding a challenging application to modeling neural dynamics in freely\nbehaving animals. Altogether, our results illustrate the potential of SING as a\ntool for accurate inference in complex dynamical systems, especially those\ncharacterized by limited prior knowledge and non-conjugate structure."}

The ONH of one eye was imaged\nunder two conditions: (1) primary gaze and (2) primary gaze with IOP elevated\nto ~35 mmHg via ophthalmo-dynamometry. Glaucoma experts classified the subjects\ninto four categories based on the presence of specific visual field defects:\n(1) superior nasal step (N=26), (2) superior partial arcuate (N=62), (3) full\nsuperior hemifield defect (N=25), and (4) other/non-specific defects (N=124).\nAutomatic ONH tissue segmentation and digital volume correlation were used to\ncompute IOP-induced neural tissue and lamina cribrosa (LC) strains.\nBiomechanical and structural features were input to a Geometric Deep Learning\nmodel. Three classification tasks were performed to detect: (1) superior nasal\nstep, (2) superior partial arcuate, (3) full superior hemifield defect.

Proper scoring rules assess the quality\nof predictions and require that the expected score gets uniquely maximized at\nthe precise prediction, in which case we call the score directly elicits the\nproperty. Previous research work has widely studied the existence and the\ncharacterization of proper scoring rules for different properties, but little\nliterature discusses the choice of proper scoring rules for applications at\nhand. In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of\nproperties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function\nof several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted\nsum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction\nto a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to\ndifferent constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the\nchoice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which\nchoice is the best. We start it with simulation studies and observe an\ninteresting pattern: in most cases, the optimal estimation of the target\nproperty changes monotonically with the increase of each weight, and the best\nconfiguration of weights is often to set some weights as zero. To understand\nhow it happens, we first establish the elementary theoretical framework and\nthen provide deeper sufficient conditions for the case of two sub-properties\nand of more sub-properties respectively. The theory on 2-D cases perfectly\ninterprets the experimental results.

While prior work has improved the timeliness and\naccuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting, converting these forecasts into\nactionable strategies remains a key challenge. A main limitation is the\ndecoupling of the prediction and the downstream decision phases, which can\nsignificantly degrade the downstream efficiency. For example, in emergency\nresponse, the priority is successful resource allocation and intervention, not\njust incident prediction. To this end, it is essential to propose an Adaptive\nSpatio-Temporal Early Decision model (ASTER) that reforms the forecasting\nparadigm from event anticipation to actionable decision support. This framework\nensures that information is directly used for decision-making, thereby\nmaximizing overall effectiveness. Specifically, ASTER introduces a new\nResource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively\ncaptures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions,\nproducing context-aware spatiotemporal representations. To directly generate\nactionable decisions, we further design a Preference-oriented decision agent\n(Poda) based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, which transforms\npredictive signals into resource-efficient intervention strategies by deriving\noptimal actions under specific preferences and dynamic constraints.\nExperimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the\nstate-of-the-art performance of ASTER in improving both early prediction\naccuracy and resource allocation outcomes across six downstream metrics."}

To address these challenges, we\nevaluate model transfer from a pretraining mixture to each of its component\ntasks, assessing whether pretrained features can match the performance of\ntask-specific direct training. We identify a fundamental limitation in deep\nlearning models -- an \"information saturation bottleneck\" -- where networks\nfail to learn new features once they encode similar competing features during\ntraining.

To address these challenges, we\npropose an adaptive expert-guided adversarial attack method that enhances both\nthe stability and efficiency of attack policy training. Our method first\nderives an expert policy from successful attack demonstrations using imitation\nlearning, strengthened by an ensemble Mixture-of-Experts architecture for\nrobust generalization across scenarios. This expert policy then guides a\nDRL-based adversary through a KL-divergence regularization term. Due to the\ndiversity of scenarios, expert policies may be imperfect. To address this, we\nfurther introduce a performance-aware annealing strategy that gradually reduces\nreliance on the expert as the adversary improves. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method achieves outperforms existing approaches in terms\nof collision rate, attack efficiency, and training stability, especially in\ncases where the expert policy is sub-optimal."}

Our\nmethod systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and\ntransferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the\nperformance degradation common in one-shot pruning approaches. Using this\nframework, we compress Phi 3.5-MoE (41.9B total/6.6B activated parameters) to\ncreate Phi-mini-MoE (7.6B total/2.4B activated parameters) and Phi-tiny-MoE\n(3.8B total/1.1B activated parameters) using only 400B tokens--less than 10% of\nthe original model's training data. These compressed models can be fine-tuned\non a single GPU (A100 for Phi-mini-MoE, A6000 for Phi-tiny-MoE), making them\nhighly suitable for academic and resource-limited settings.

Our dataset\ncomprises over 37,000 real-world prompts from public LLM chat logs, each\nannotated with a structured schema capturing task templates, shared context,\nand iteration inputs. These schemas are extracted using LLM-assisted prompting\nwith rule-based multilingual validation. To evaluate the benefits of\ndecomposition, we provide an execution suite that benchmarks serial vs.\nparallel strategies, measuring latency, structural adherence, and semantic\nfidelity. Our results show that intra-query parallelism can be successfully\nparsed in over 75% of curated datasets, unlocking up to 5x speedups on tasks\nlike translation, comprehension, and comparative analysis, with minimal quality\ndegradation. By releasing this benchmark, curation pipeline, and evaluation\nsuite, we provide the first standardized testbed for studying structure-aware\nexecution in LLM serving pipelines."}
