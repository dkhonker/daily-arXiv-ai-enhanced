An\nimportant, albeit implicit, assumption of these labels is that they accurately\ncapture what any human would think, effectively treating human common sense as\nhomogeneous. However, recent empirical work has shown that humans vary\nenormously in what they consider commonsensical; thus what appears self-evident\nto one benchmark designer may not be so to another. Here, we propose a novel\nmethod for evaluating common sense in artificial intelligence (AI),\nspecifically in large language models (LLMs), that incorporates empirically\nobserved heterogeneity among humans by measuring the correspondence between a\nmodel's judgment and that of a human population. We first find that, when\ntreated as independent survey respondents, most LLMs remain below the human\nmedian in their individual commonsense competence.

In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability\ndictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic\nencoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We\nexperimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and\nsystematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in\nTransformers.

However, the origin of this\nneural scaling law -- the finding that loss decreases as a power law with model\nsize -- remains unclear. Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs\nrepresent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,\nrepresentations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur\nwith varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss\nscaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only\nthe most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of\nloss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature\nfrequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong\nsuperposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,\nthe loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide\nrange of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is\nexplained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower\ndimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales\ninversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced\nLLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match\nthe predictions of our toy model. The Chinchilla scaling law turned out to also\nagree with our results. We conclude that representation superposition is an\nimportant mechanism underlying the observed neural scaling laws.

We investigate this question through an ablation\nanalysis of inductive human learning simulations in online tutoring\nenvironments. Comparing reinforcement learning to a more data-efficient\n3-mechanism symbolic rule induction approach, we find that decomposing learning\ninto multiple distinct mechanisms significantly improves data efficiency,\nbringing it in line with human learning.

Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs\nrepresent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,\nrepresentations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur\nwith varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss\nscaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only\nthe most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of\nloss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature\nfrequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong\nsuperposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,\nthe loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide\nrange of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is\nexplained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower\ndimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales\ninversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced\nLLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match\nthe predictions of our toy model.

For example, a large ensemble of global\ntemperature sensitivity fields from a climate model can help farmers, insurers,\nand governments plan appropriately. When acquiring more data is prohibitively\nexpensive -- as is the case with climate models -- statistical emulation offers\nan efficient alternative for simulating synthetic yet realistic fields.\nHowever, parameter inference using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is\ncomputationally prohibitive, especially for large, non-stationary fields. Thus,\nmany recent works train neural networks to estimate parameters given spatial\nfields as input, sidestepping MLE completely. In this work we focus on a\npopular class of parametric, spatially autoregressive (SAR) models.

Sparse portfolio selection extends this by imposing\na cardinality constraint: only $k$ assets from a universe of $p$ may be\nincluded. The standard approach models this problem as a mixed-integer\nquadratic program and relies on commercial solvers to find the optimal\nsolution. However, the computational costs of such methods increase\nexponentially with $k$ and $p$, making them too slow for problems of even\nmoderate size. We propose a fast and scalable gradient-based approach that\ntransforms the combinatorial sparse selection problem into a constrained\ncontinuous optimization task via Boolean relaxation, while preserving\nequivalence with the original problem on the set of binary points. Our\nalgorithm employs a tunable parameter that transmutes the auxiliary objective\nfrom a convex to a concave function. This allows a stable convex starting\npoint, followed by a controlled path toward a sparse binary solution as the\ntuning parameter increases and the objective moves toward concavity. In\npractice, our method matches commercial solvers in asset selection for most\ninstances and, in rare instances, the solution differs by a few assets whilst\nshowing a negligible error in portfolio variance."}

This latter capacity is captured by\nempowerment, which has served as a vital framing concept across artificial\nintelligence and cognitive science. This former capacity, however, is equally\nfoundational: In what ways, and to what extent, can an agent be influenced by\nwhat it observes? In this paper, we ground this concept in a universal\nagent-centric measure that we refer to as plasticity, and reveal a fundamental\nconnection to empowerment. Following a set of desiderata on a suitable\ndefinition, we define plasticity using a new information-theoretic quantity we\ncall the generalized directed information. We show that this new quantity\nstrictly generalizes the directed information introduced by Massey (1990) while\npreserving all of its desirable properties. Our first finding is that\nplasticity is the mirror of empowerment: The agent's plasticity is identical to\nthe empowerment of the environment, and vice versa. Our second finding\nestablishes a tension between the plasticity and empowerment of an agent,\nsuggesting that agent design needs to be mindful of both characteristics. We\nexplore the implications of these findings, and suggest that plasticity,\nempowerment, and their relationship are essential to understanding agency."}

We introduce FlowVAT, a\nconditional tempering approach for normalizing flow variational inference that\naddresses these limitations. Our method tempers both the base and target\ndistributions simultaneously, maintaining affine-invariance under tempering. By\nconditioning the normalizing flow on temperature, we leverage overparameterized\nneural networks' generalization capabilities to train a single flow\nrepresenting the posterior across a range of temperatures.
