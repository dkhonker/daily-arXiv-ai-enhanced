This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model\ndevelopment, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input\nembeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can\nemerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual\nstructure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed\nrepresentational substrate acts as a universal \"docking port,\" enabling two\npowerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and\nprogressive layer-wise growth.\n  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,\nRussian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural\nmodification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The\nresulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning\nbenchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic\nforgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training\nmethodology, where a deep Transformer is \"grown\" by progressively stacking and\ntraining one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a\nclear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning\nabilities, such as those required for SQuAD.\n  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a\nmore biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is\nbuilt incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues\nfor resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized\necosystem for building powerful AI systems.

While quantization to 8 or 4\nbits mitigates this, sub-3-bit methods face severe accuracy, scalability, and\nefficiency degradation. We propose Convolutional Code Quantization (CCQ), an\ninference-optimized quantization approach compressing LLMs to 2.0-2.75 bits\nwith minimal accuracy loss. Departing from error-prone scalar quantization or\nslow vector quantization, CCQ integrates a hardware-aware bit-shift encoding\nand decoding solution with Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code\nCluster, jointly overcoming accuracy-speed bottlenecks. We construct a\nlookup-free encoding space, enabling a linear mapping between the codebook and\nweight vectors, thereby optimizing inference performance.

The aggregated prototypes are then distributed back to\nclients and integrated into local training, supported by SMOTE-based\naugmentation to enhance representation of minority malware classes. Rather than\nrelying solely on parameter averaging, our prototype-driven mechanism enables\nclients to enrich their local models with complementary structural patterns\nobserved across the federation -- without exchanging raw data or gradients.\nThis targeted strategy reduces the adverse impact of statistical heterogeneity\nwith minimal communication overhead.

However, their capabilities\ncan be exploited for both benign and harmful purposes. Despite rigorous\ntraining and fine-tuning for safety, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak\nattacks. Recently, multi-turn attacks have emerged, exacerbating the issue.\nUnlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks gradually escalate the dialogue,\nmaking them more difficult to detect and mitigate, even after they are\nidentified.\n  In this study, we propose G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware GNN-based\ninput classifier designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on\nLLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, explicitly\ncapturing relationships between harmful keywords and queries even when those\nkeywords appear only in previous queries.

Recent advances in dynamic\nmode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to\nidentify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this\nidea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to\nlearn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these\nmethods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable\noperations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value\ndecomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can\nintroduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In\nthis work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning\nthe top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical\nsystems based on the idea of low-rank approximation.

This restriction makes performing multi-dimensional tensor operations\nchallenging. Practitioners must pack these tensors into 1-D vectors and map\ntensor operations onto this one-dimensional layout rather than their\ntraditional nested structure.

Over the next 200\nyears, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to\nexperiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.\nAround 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for\norchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were\nthen reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on\nseveral characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.\nlines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced\ninstruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by\nexperts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or\nnon-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments\nwhose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each\ninstrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.\nEach line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y\n= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)\nand how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional\nfeatures from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values\nfall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of\nlevels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.\n  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can\npredict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non\nreduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a\nwhole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more\ndifficult to quantify the reduction.

Adaptive sensing proactively\nmodulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal\nconfigurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts\nand improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates\nthat adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass\nsubstantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more\ndata and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive\nsensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous\nsystems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess\ntechnical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted\nresearch directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive\nalgorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods.\nCollectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward\nsustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper advocates for adaptive sensing as a necessary shift in AI systems design, demonstrating its potential to improve efficiency and performance while addressing sustainability and equitable access concerns.", "motivation": "The current trend of scaling neural models and expanding training datasets incurs significant environmental, economic, and ethical costs.

In our model, several edge devices jointly perform collaborative\ntraining, and some eavesdroppers aim to collect the model and data information\nfrom devices.

Real-time AD\nrequires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also\noperate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical\ninstances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We\npropose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for\nmultivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach.\nUnlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that\nprocess entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors\nthe correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling\nefficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking\npractices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy\ntailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on\nwidely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most\nconsistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing\ndimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time,\nhigh-dimensional data streams.

We introduce a\ncollection of new techniques that enable a dynamic chunking mechanism which\nautomatically learns content -- and context -- dependent segmentation\nstrategies learned jointly with the rest of the model. Incorporating this into\nan explicit hierarchical network (H-Net) allows replacing the (implicitly\nhierarchical) tokenization-LM-detokenization pipeline with a single model\nlearned fully end-to-end. When compute- and data- matched, an H-Net with one\nstage of hierarchy operating at the byte level outperforms a strong Transformer\nlanguage model operating over BPE tokens. Iterating the hierarchy to multiple\nstages further increases its performance by modeling multiple levels of\nabstraction, demonstrating significantly better scaling with data and matching\na token-based Transformer of twice its size. H-Nets pretrained on English show\nsignificantly increased character-level robustness, and qualitatively learn\nmeaningful data-dependent chunking strategies without any heuristics or\nexplicit supervision. Finally, the H-Net's improvement over tokenized pipelines\nis further increased in languages and modalities with weaker tokenization\nheuristics, such as Chinese and code, or DNA sequences (nearly 4x improvement\nin data efficiency over baselines), showing the potential of true end-to-end\nmodels that learn and scale better from unprocessed data.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper addresses the issue of tokenization being a barrier for end-to-end language models by introducing H-Nets, which use a dynamic chunking mechanism to learn segmentation strategies jointly with the model, resulting in superior performance across different languages and data types.", "motivation": "The motivation is to overcome the barrier that pre-processing steps such as tokenization present to true end-to-end foundation models in language modeling.", "method": "The paper introduces new techniques for dynamic chunking and incorporates them into an explicit hierarchical network (H-Net) that operates at multiple levels of abstraction, replacing the traditional tokenization-LM-detokenization pipeline.", "result": "H-Nets outperform strong Transformer language models when compute- and data-matched, show increased robustness and learn meaningful data-dependent chunking strategies.

Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they\nadequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large\nlanguage model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better\nand even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each\nlayer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple\ntimes as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary\norders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space\ngreatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained\nmodules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample\nfrom math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a\nfixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same\nlayer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic\narchitectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the\nMCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples\nwith correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa,\nsuggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of\nsamples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving\ncorrect predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement.
