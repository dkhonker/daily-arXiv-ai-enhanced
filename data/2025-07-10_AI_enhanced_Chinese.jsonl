Evaluated on two ICU datasets across five clinical\nprediction tasks (90-day mortality, 30-day readmission, ICU mortality,\nremaining length of stay, and phenotyping), KnowRare consistently outperformed\nexisting state-of-the-art models. Additionally, KnowRare demonstrated superior\npredictive performance compared to established ICU scoring systems, including\nAPACHE IV and IV-a. Case studies further demonstrated KnowRare's flexibility in\nadapting its parameters to accommodate dataset-specific and task-specific\ncharacteristics, its generalisation to common conditions under limited data\nscenarios, and its rationality in selecting source conditions. These findings\nhighlight KnowRare's potential as a robust and practical solution for\nsupporting clinical decision-making and improving care for rare conditions in\nthe ICU.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aKnowRare\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5148\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u91cd\u75c7\u76d1\u62a4\u4e2d\u7f55\u89c1\u75c5\u75c7\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5df2\u7ecf\u5728\u5e38\u89c1\u75c5\u75c7\u7684\u91cd\u75c7\u76d1\u62a4\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u9769\u547d\u6027\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u548c\u75c5\u75c7\u5185\u90e8\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0cICU\u4e2d\u7684\u7f55\u89c1\u75c5\u75c7\u4ecd\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u670d\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86KnowRare\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4bICU\u4e2d\u7f55\u89c1\u75c5\u75c7\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ece\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u75c5\u75c7\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u75c5\u75c7\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u4ece\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u75c5\u75c7\u4e2d\u9002\u5e94\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2aICU\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cKnowRare\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6bd4\u5305\u62ecAPACHE IV\u548cIV-a\u5728\u5185\u7684\u5df2\u5efa\u7acb\u7684ICU\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u663e\u793a\u4e86KnowRare\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5e38\u89c1\u75c5\u75c7\u4ee5\u53ca\u5408\u7406\u9009\u62e9\u6e90\u75c5\u75c7\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "KnowRare\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u6210\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u6539\u5584ICU\u4e2d\u7f55\u89c1\u75c5\u75c7\u62a4\u7406\u7684\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing attacks typically target the entire user group, which\ncompromises stealth and increases the risk of detection. In contrast,\nreal-world adversaries may prefer to prompt target items to specific user\nsubgroups, such as recommending health supplements to elderly users. Motivated\nby this gap, we introduce Spattack, the first targeted poisoning attack\ndesigned to manipulate recommendations for specific user subgroups in the\nfederated setting. Specifically, Spattack adopts a two-stage\napproximation-and-promotion strategy, which first simulates user embeddings of\ntarget/non-target subgroups and then prompts target items to the target\nsubgroups. To enhance the approximation stage, we push the inter-group\nembeddings away based on contrastive learning and augment the target group's\nrelevant item set based on clustering. To enhance the promotion stage, we\nfurther propose to adaptively tune the optimization weights between target and\nnon-target subgroups. Besides, an embedding alignment strategy is proposed to\nalign the embeddings between the target items and the relevant items.

We evaluate FMSPs in Car Tag, a\ncontinuous-control pursuer-evader setting, and in Gandalf, a simple AI safety\nsimulation in which an attacker tries to jailbreak an LLM's defenses. In Car\nTag, FMSPs explore a wide variety of reinforcement learning, tree search, and\nheuristic-based methods, to name just a few. In terms of discovered policy\nquality, \\ouralgo and vFMSP surpass strong human-designed strategies. In\nGandalf, FMSPs can successfully automatically red-team an LLM, breaking through\nand jailbreaking six different, progressively stronger levels of defense.\nFurthermore, FMSPs can automatically proceed to patch the discovered\nvulnerabilities. Overall, FMSPs represent a promising new research frontier of\nimproving self-play with foundation models, opening fresh paths toward more\ncreative and open-ended strategy discovery", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces Foundation-Model Self-Play (FMSP), a new approach that uses foundation models to improve upon traditional self-play algorithms in multi-agent interactions.", "motivation": "The motivation is to overcome the limitations of traditional self-play algorithms which often fail to produce diverse solutions and can get stuck in locally optimal behaviors by introducing Foundation-Model Self-Play (FMSP).", "method": "The paper proposes a family of approaches including Vanilla Foundation-Model Self-Play (vFMSP), Novelty-Search Self-Play (NSSP), and Quality-Diversity Self-Play (QDSP) that leverage the code-generation capabilities and vast knowledge of foundation models to overcome challenges in self-play algorithms.", "result": "In Car Tag, FMSPs explore a wide variety of methods and surpass strong human-designed strategies in terms of discovered policy quality.

Project page:\n  https://anitaleungxx.github.io/ReMix", "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the\nreasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most\nexisting Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL\nin nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully\nutilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,\nposing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To\nthis end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating\nMix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable\non-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix\nconsists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient\nwith an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)\nKL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and\nflexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from\nefficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our\nexperiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base\nmodels. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with\n0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B\nmodel) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math\nreasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and\nMATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level\nperformance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of\nrollout data volume.

Recently, several studies\nhighlighted the impact of the geometry of training trajectories on the\ngeneralization error, both theoretically and empirically. Among these works, a\nseries of topological generalization bounds have been proposed, relating the\ngeneralization error to notions of topological complexity that stem from\ntopological data analysis (TDA). Despite their empirical success, these bounds\nrely on intricate information-theoretic (IT) terms that can be bounded in\nspecific cases but remain intractable for practical algorithms (such as ADAM),\npotentially reducing the relevance of the derived bounds. In this paper, we\nseek to formulate comprehensive and interpretable topological generalization\nbounds free of intractable mutual information terms. To this end, we introduce\na novel learning theoretic framework that departs from the existing strategies\nvia proof techniques rooted in algorithmic stability.

These results demonstrate that ensemble\nembedding methods significantly outperform single-model approaches in\ndistinguishing between semantically similar and dissimilar queries, leading to\nmore effective caching performance and reduced computational overhead in\nLLM-based systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper presents an ensemble embedding approach to improve semantic similarity detection in LLM caching systems, achieving a high cache hit ratio and effectively rejecting non-equivalent queries.", "motivation": "Existing semantic caching frameworks rely on single embedding models for query representation, which limits their ability to capture the diverse semantic relationships present in real-world query distributions.", "method": "An ensemble embedding approach that combines multiple embedding models through a trained meta-encoder to improve semantic similarity detection in LLM caching systems.", "result": "The ensemble approach achieves a 92% cache hit ratio for semantically equivalent queries while maintaining an 85% accuracy in correctly rejecting non-equivalent queries as cache misses.", "conclusion": "Ensemble embedding methods significantly outperform single-model approaches in distinguishing between semantically similar and dissimilar queries, leading to more effective caching performance and reduced computational overhead in LLM-based systems."}}

The dominant machine\nlearning paradigm is built on the premise that scaling data and model sizes\nwill improve out-of-distribution performance, including compositional\ngeneralization. We test this premise through controlled experiments that\nsystematically vary data scale, concept diversity, and combination coverage. We\nfind that compositional generalization is driven by data diversity, not mere\ndata scale. Increased combinatorial coverage forces models to discover a\nlinearly factored representational structure, where concepts decompose into\nadditive components.

Evaluating pretrained\nmodels (DINO, CLIP), we find above-random yet imperfect performance, suggesting\npartial presence of this structure.
