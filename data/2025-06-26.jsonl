Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and\nDeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems\nfor medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and\nsafety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2\nemissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various\nopen-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like\nllama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs\nperformance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs\no4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation.\nResults Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy\nconsumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy\n(58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and\nDeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption\nand CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a\ntotal CO2 emission of 473g.

This paper closes the gap with a new $\\ell_0$ regularized method for\nLMM subset selection that can run on datasets containing thousands of\npredictors in seconds to minutes. On the computational front, we develop a\ncoordinate descent algorithm as our main workhorse and provide a guarantee of\nits convergence. We also develop a local search algorithm to help traverse the\nnonconvex optimization surface. Both algorithms readily extend to subset\nselection in generalized LMMs via a penalized quasi-likelihood approximation.\nOn the statistical front, we provide a finite-sample bound on the\nKullback-Leibler divergence of the new method. We then demonstrate its\nexcellent performance in synthetic experiments and illustrate its utility on\ntwo datasets from biology and journalism."}

DeKA-g comprises two novel methods: metaword-aided knowledge\ndistillation (MAKD) and variable-rate grouped SNR adaptation (VGSA).

However, a significant challenge remains in ensuring that transferred\nfeatures are sufficient to handle unseen datasets, amplified by the difficulty\nof quantifying whether two tasks are \"related\". To address these challenges, we\nevaluate model transfer from a pretraining mixture to each of its component\ntasks, assessing whether pretrained features can match the performance of\ntask-specific direct training. We identify a fundamental limitation in deep\nlearning models -- an \"information saturation bottleneck\" -- where networks\nfail to learn new features once they encode similar competing features during\ntraining. When restricted to learning only a subset of key features during\npretraining, models will permanently lose critical features for transfer and\nperform inconsistently on data distributions, even components of the training\nmixture. Empirical evidence from published studies suggests that this\nphenomenon is pervasive in deep learning architectures -- factors such as data\ndistribution or ordering affect the features that current representation\nlearning methods can learn over time.

Data affected by priming can lead\nto misclassifications when used in learning models. This study proposes the\nAffective Priming Score (APS), a data-driven method to detect data points\ninfluenced by the priming effect. The APS assigns a score to each data point,\nquantifying the extent to which it is affected by priming. To validate this\nmethod, we apply it to the SEED and SEED-VII datasets, which contain sufficient\ntransitions between emotional events to exhibit priming effects. We train\nmodels with the same configuration using both the original data and\npriming-free sequences. The misclassification rate is significantly reduced\nwhen using priming-free sequences compared to the original data. This work\ncontributes to the broader challenge of ambiguity by identifying and mitigating\npriming effects at the data level, enhancing model robustness, and offering\nvaluable insights for the design and collection of affective computing\ndatasets."}

However,\nexisting methods often overlook the shared information across clusters, which\nrepresents the generalizable knowledge valuable to all participants in the\nFederated Learning (FL) system. To overcome this limitation, this paper\nintroduces a novel FL framework that distills a universal expert model from the\nknowledge of multiple clusters. This universal expert captures globally shared\ninformation across all clients and is subsequently distributed to each client\nas the initialization for the next round of model training. The proposed FL\nframework operates in three iterative steps: (1) local model training at each\nclient, (2) cluster-specific model aggregation, and (3) universal expert\ndistillation. This three-step learning paradigm ensures the preservation of\nfine-grained non-IID characteristics while effectively incorporating shared\nknowledge across clusters.

One major challenge in FL\nis handling the non-identical and independent distributed (non-IID) data.\nCurrent solutions either focus on constructing an all-powerful global model, or\ncustomizing personalized local models. Few of them can provide both a\nwell-generalized global model and well-performed local models at the same time.\nAdditionally, many FL solutions to the non-IID problem are benefited from\nintroducing public datasets.

We use MVPA to build MVPFormer, a\ngenerative foundation model for human electrophysiology, trained to predict the\nevolution of iEEG signals across diverse subjects. To support this and future\neffort by the community, we release the SWEC iEEG dataset, the largest publicly\navailable iEEG dataset to date, comprising nearly 10,000 hours of recordings\nfrom heterogeneous clinical sources. MVPFormer leverages MVPA to achieve strong\ngeneralization across subjects, demonstrating expert-level performance in\nseizure detection and outperforming state-of-the-art Transformer baselines on\nour SWEC, the MAYO, and the FNUSA dataset. We further validate MVPA on standard\ntime-series forecasting and classification tasks, where it matches or exceeds\nexisting attention-based models. Together, our contributions establish MVPA as\na general-purpose attention mechanism for heterogeneous time-series and\nMVPFormer as the first open-source, open-weights, and open-data iEEG foundation\nmodel with state-of-the-art clinical performance.

However, this introduces a high-dimensionality-induced\nfeature explosion problem, which reduces the efficiency and interpretability of\nthe data, thereby reducing the accuracy of machine learning models. To overcome\nthis issue, feature selection has become one of the most prevalent tools. Thus,\nthe objective of this paper was to introduce a taxonomy-based feature selection\nmethod that categorizes features based on their internal structure. This\napproach classifies the data into geometric and kinematic features, further\ncategorizing them into curvature, indentation, speed, and acceleration. The\ncomparative analysis indicated that a taxonomy-based approach consistently\nachieved comparable or superior predictive performance. Furthermore, due to the\ntaxonomic grouping, which reduces combinatorial space, the time taken to select\nfeatures was drastically reduced. The taxonomy was also used to gain insights\ninto what feature sets each dataset was more sensitive to.

Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) is an elegant and\nempirically effective approach to this problem, yet its theoretical properties\nremain poorly understood. This paper establishes that, under deterministic\nconditions, a variant of IRLS with dynamic smoothing regularization converges\nlinearly to the underlying subspace from any initialization. We extend these\nguarantees to affine subspace estimation, a setting that lacks prior recovery\ntheory. Additionally, we illustrate the practical benefits of IRLS through an\napplication to low-dimensional neural network training. Our results provide the\nfirst global convergence guarantees for IRLS in robust subspace recovery and,\nmore broadly, for nonconvex IRLS on a Riemannian manifold."}

Therefore, the question of\nwhether and how public datasets should be prefiltered to facilitate accurate\ndownstream learning arises. On a technical level this requires the construction\nof principled data prefiltering methods which are learner-agnostic robust, in\nthe sense of provably protecting a set of pre-specified downstream learners\nfrom corrupted data. In this work, we formalize the problem of Learner-Agnostic\nRobust data Prefiltering (LARP), which aims at finding prefiltering procedures\nthat minimize a worst-case loss over a pre-specified set of learners. We first\ninstantiate our framework in the context of scalar mean estimation with Huber\nestimators under the Huber data contamination model. We provide a hardness\nresult on a specific problem instance and analyze several natural prefiltering\nprocedures. Our theoretical results indicate that performing LARP on a\nheterogeneous set of learners leads to some loss in model performance compared\nto the alternative of prefiltering data for each learner/use-case individually.\nWe explore the resulting utility loss and its dependence on the problem\nparameters via extensive experiments on real-world image and tabular data,\nobserving statistically significant reduction in utility. Finally, we model the\ntrade-off between the utility drop and the cost of repeated (learner-specific)\nprefiltering within a game-theoretic framework and showcase benefits of LARP\nfor large datasets."}

However, existing agents typically operate\nin isolation on a given research problem, without engaging with the broader\nresearch community, where human researchers often gain insights and contribute\nby sharing knowledge. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLE-Live, a live\nevaluation framework designed to assess an agent's ability to communicate with\nand leverage collective knowledge from a simulated Kaggle research community.\nBuilding on this framework, we propose CoMind, a novel agent that excels at\nexchanging insights and developing novel solutions within a community context.\nCoMind achieves state-of-the-art performance on MLE-Live and outperforms 79.2%\nhuman competitors on average across four ongoing Kaggle competitions.
