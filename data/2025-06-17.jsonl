Non-linear attention mechanisms offer a means to\nenhance the capabilities of transformer models for various sequence modeling\ntasks by improving the model's understanding of complex relationships, learning\nof representations, and overall efficiency and performance.

Most coarsening\nframeworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting\nmatrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a\ncoarsening that minimizes the RSA.

In\ncontrast to widely used English-language benchmarks that often rely on\nartificially difficult or decontextualized problems, this dataset draws from\nreal middle school curricula across nine domains including mathematics,\nhistory, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended\nquestions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual\ninterpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual\ncues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple\ndimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial\ncrafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve\nless than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music,\nmathematics, and adversarial settings.

However, the increasingly marginal performance gains\nsuggest that existing quantization strategies are insufficient to support the\ndevelopment of more compressed models. To inspire new directions for future\nresearch, this paper introduces the concept of null space into LLMs\nquantization. We argue that the quantization error can be effectively\nalleviated by constraining the post-quantization weight perturbation to lie\nwithin the null space of input activations. To prove this idea, we propose a\nplug-and-play null space projection module for existing milestone PTQ baselines\nnamed Q2N.

While large language models (LLMs) have emerged as\npromising tools for CO--either by directly generating solutions or synthesizing\nsolver-specific codes--existing approaches often neglect critical structural\npriors inherent to CO problems, leading to suboptimality and iterative\ninefficiency. Inspired by human experts' success in leveraging CO structures\nfor algorithm design, we propose STRCMP, a novel structure-aware LLM-based\nalgorithm discovery framework that systematically integrates structure priors\nto enhance solution quality and solving efficiency. Our framework combines a\ngraph neural network (GNN) for extracting structural embeddings from CO\ninstances with an LLM conditioned on these embeddings to identify\nhigh-performing algorithms in the form of solver-specific codes. This composite\narchitecture ensures syntactic correctness, preserves problem topology, and\naligns with natural language objectives, while an evolutionary refinement\nprocess iteratively optimizes generated algorithm. Extensive evaluations across\nMixed Integer Linear Programming and Boolean Satisfiability problems, using\nnine benchmark datasets, demonstrate that our proposed STRCMP outperforms five\nstrong neural and LLM-based methods by a large margin, in terms of both\nsolution optimality and computational efficiency.

Existing\nnode label noise models like Symmetric Label Noise (SLN) and Class Conditional\nNoise (CCN) disregard this important node relationship in graph data; and the\nEdge-Dependent Noise (EDN) model addresses this limitation. EDN posits that in\nreal-world scenarios, label noise may be influenced by the connections between\nnodes. We explore three variants of EDN. A crucial notion that relates nodes\nand edges in a graph is the degree of a node; we show that in all three\nvariants, the probability of a node's label corruption is dependent on its\ndegree. Additionally, we compare the dependence of these probabilities on node\ndegree across different variants. We performed experiments on popular graph\ndatasets using 5 different GNN architectures and 8 noise robust algorithms for\ngraph data. The results demonstrate that 2 variants of EDN lead to greater\nperformance degradation in both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and existing\nnoise-robust algorithms, as compared to traditional node label noise models. We\nstatistically verify this by posing a suitable hypothesis-testing problem. This\nemphasizes the importance of incorporating EDN when evaluating noise robust\nalgorithms for graphs, to enhance the reliability of graph-based learning in\nnoisy environments."}

Many real-world\napplications, such as manufacturing and drug discovery, involve function\nnetworks with additional properties - nodes that can be evaluated independently\nand incur varying costs. A recent BOFN variant, p-KGFN, leverages this\nstructure and enables cost-aware partial evaluations, selectively querying only\na subset of nodes at each iteration. p-KGFN reduces the number of expensive\nobjective function evaluations needed but has a large computational overhead:\nchoosing where to evaluate requires optimizing a nested Monte Carlo-based\nacquisition function for each node in the network. To address this, we propose\nan accelerated p-KGFN algorithm that reduces computational overhead with only a\nmodest loss in query efficiency. Key to our approach is generation of\nnode-specific candidate inputs for each node in the network via one inexpensive\nglobal Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical experiments show that our method\nmaintains competitive query efficiency while achieving up to a 16x speedup over\nthe original p-KGFN algorithm."}

In this work, we focus on Bayesian parameter estimation and\nexplore different methods to reduce the computational cost of sampling from the\nposterior distribution by leveraging low-fidelity approximations. A common\napproach is to construct a surrogate model for the high-fidelity simulation\nitself. Another is to build a surrogate for the discrepancy between high- and\nlow-fidelity models. This discrepancy, which is often easier to approximate, is\nmodeled with either a fully connected neural network or a nonlinear\ndimensionality reduction technique that enables surrogate construction in a\nlower-dimensional space. A third possible approach is to treat the discrepancy\nbetween the high-fidelity and surrogate models as random noise and estimate its\ndistribution using normalizing flows. This allows us to incorporate the\napproximation error into the Bayesian inverse problem by modifying the\nlikelihood function. We validate five different methods which are variations of\nthe above on analytical test cases by comparing them to posterior distributions\nderived solely from high-fidelity models, assessing both accuracy and\ncomputational cost.
