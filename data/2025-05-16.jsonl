This research investigates the use of\nauthorship verification (AV) techniques not as a punitive measure, but as a\nmeans to quantify AI assistance in academic writing, with a focus on promoting\ntransparency, interpretability, and student development. Building on prior\nwork, we structured our investigation into three stages: dataset selection and\nexpansion, AV method development, and systematic evaluation. Using three\ndatasets - including a public dataset (PAN-14) and two from University of\nMelbourne students from various courses - we expanded the data to include\nLLM-generated texts, totalling 1,889 documents and 540 authorship problems from\n506 students. We developed an adapted Feature Vector Difference AV methodology\nto construct robust academic writing profiles for students, designed to capture\nmeaningful, individual characteristics of their writing. The method's\neffectiveness was evaluated across multiple scenarios, including distinguishing\nbetween student-authored and LLM-generated texts and testing resilience against\nLLMs' attempts to mimic student writing styles. Results demonstrate the\nenhanced AV classifier's ability to identify stylometric discrepancies and\nmeasure human-AI collaboration at word and sentence levels while providing\neducators with a transparent tool to support academic integrity investigations.\nThis work advances AV technology, offering actionable insights into the\ndynamics of academic writing in an AI-driven era."}

TUGS employs lightweight\ntensorized higher-order Gaussians with a physics-based underwater Adaptive\nMedium Estimation (AME) module, enabling accurate simulation of both light\nattenuation and backscatter effects in underwater environments. Compared to\nother NeRF-based and GS-based methods designed for underwater, TUGS is able to\nrender high-quality underwater images with faster rendering speeds and less\nmemory usage. Extensive experiments on real-world underwater datasets have\ndemonstrated that TUGS can efficiently achieve superior reconstruction quality\nusing a limited number of parameters, making it particularly suitable for\nmemory-constrained underwater UAV applications"}

We find statistically significant evidence that the magnitude of\ncontextual entrainment is influenced by semantic factors. Counterfactual\nprompts have a greater effect compared to factual ones, suggesting that while\ncontextual entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, it is modulated by semantic\nfactors.\n  We hypothesise that there is a circuit of attention heads -- the entrainment\nheads -- that corresponds to the contextual entrainment phenomenon.

Hidden-model POMDPs (HM-POMDPs) capture sets of different\nenvironment models, that is, POMDPs with a shared action and observation space.\nThe intuition is that the true model is hidden among a set of potential models,\nand it is unknown which model will be the environment at execution time. A\npolicy is robust for a given HM-POMDP if it achieves sufficient performance for\neach of its POMDPs. We compute such robust policies by combining two orthogonal\ntechniques: (1) a deductive formal verification technique that supports\ntractable robust policy evaluation by computing a worst-case POMDP within the\nHM-POMDP and (2) subgradient ascent to optimize the candidate policy for a\nworst-case POMDP.

Recent work has shown\nthat deep linear networks tend to be resilient towards loss of plasticity.\nMotivated by this observation, we propose Adaptive Linearization (AdaLin), a\ngeneral approach that dynamically adapts each neuron's activation function to\nmitigate plasticity loss. Unlike prior methods that rely on regularization or\nperiodic resets, AdaLin equips every neuron with a learnable parameter and a\ngating mechanism that injects linearity into the activation function based on\nits gradient flow. This adaptive modulation ensures sufficient gradient signal\nand sustains continual learning without introducing additional hyperparameters\nor requiring explicit task boundaries. When used with conventional activation\nfunctions like ReLU, Tanh, and GeLU, we demonstrate that AdaLin can\nsignificantly improve performance on standard benchmarks, including Random\nLabel and Permuted MNIST, Random Label and Shuffled CIFAR-10, and Class-Split\nCIFAR-100.

Then, the probability of areas\nlacking vegetation cover was assessed using socio-economic, environmental and\nsensitivity indices. This resulted in the RF generating an urban green space\ndevelopment prioritization map. Feature Importance Analysis revealed that the\nmost significant indices were nightly land surface temperature (LST) and\nsensitive population. Finally, the framework performance was validated through\nmicroclimate simulation to assess the critical areas after and before the green\nspace development by green roofs.

Yet, learning effective long-context policies from\ndemonstrations remains challenging. As context length increases, training\nbecomes increasingly expensive due to rising memory demands, and policy\nperformance often degrades as a result of spurious correlations. Recent methods\ntypically sidestep these issues by truncating context length, discarding\nhistorical information that may be critical for subsequent decisions. In this\npaper, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly regularizes the\nretention of past information. We first revisit the copycat problem in\nimitation learning and identify an opposite challenge in recent diffusion\npolicies: rather than over-relying on prior actions, they often fail to capture\nessential dependencies between past and future actions. To address this, we\nintroduce Past-Token Prediction (PTP), an auxiliary task in which the policy\nlearns to predict past action tokens alongside future ones. This regularization\nsignificantly improves temporal modeling in the policy head, with minimal\nreliance on visual representations. Building on this observation, we further\nintroduce a multistage training strategy: pre-train the visual encoder with\nshort contexts, and fine-tune the policy head using cached long-context\nembeddings. This strategy preserves the benefits of PTP while greatly reducing\nmemory and computational overhead. Finally, we extend PTP into a\nself-verification mechanism at test time, enabling the policy to score and\nselect candidates consistent with past actions during inference.

Existing benchmarking frameworks fail to adequately\ncapture this bias, as they rely on rigid, closed-form assessments that overlook\nthe complexity of cultural inclusivity. To address this, we introduce\nWorldView-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Global Cultural Inclusivity\n(GCI) in LLMs by analyzing their ability to accommodate diverse worldviews. Our\napproach is grounded in the Multiplex Worldview proposed by Senturk et al.,\nwhich distinguishes between Uniplex models, reinforcing cultural\nhomogenization, and Multiplex models, which integrate diverse perspectives.\nWorldView-Bench measures Cultural Polarization, the exclusion of alternative\nperspectives, through free-form generative evaluation rather than conventional\ncategorical benchmarks. We implement applied multiplexity through two\nintervention strategies: (1) Contextually-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, where\nsystem prompts embed multiplexity principles, and (2) Multi-Agent System\n(MAS)-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, where multiple LLM agents representing\ndistinct cultural perspectives collaboratively generate responses. Our results\ndemonstrate a significant increase in Perspectives Distribution Score (PDS)\nentropy from 13% at baseline to 94% with MAS-Implemented Multiplex LLMs,\nalongside a shift toward positive sentiment (67.7%) and enhanced cultural\nbalance.

Yet, learning effective long-context policies from\ndemonstrations remains challenging. As context length increases, training\nbecomes increasingly expensive due to rising memory demands, and policy\nperformance often degrades as a result of spurious correlations. Recent methods\ntypically sidestep these issues by truncating context length, discarding\nhistorical information that may be critical for subsequent decisions. In this\npaper, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly regularizes the\nretention of past information. We first revisit the copycat problem in\nimitation learning and identify an opposite challenge in recent diffusion\npolicies: rather than over-relying on prior actions, they often fail to capture\nessential dependencies between past and future actions. To address this, we\nintroduce Past-Token Prediction (PTP), an auxiliary task in which the policy\nlearns to predict past action tokens alongside future ones. This regularization\nsignificantly improves temporal modeling in the policy head, with minimal\nreliance on visual representations. Building on this observation, we further\nintroduce a multistage training strategy: pre-train the visual encoder with\nshort contexts, and fine-tune the policy head using cached long-context\nembeddings. This strategy preserves the benefits of PTP while greatly reducing\nmemory and computational overhead. Finally, we extend PTP into a\nself-verification mechanism at test time, enabling the policy to score and\nselect candidates consistent with past actions during inference. Experiments\nacross four real-world and six simulated tasks demonstrate that our proposed\nmethod improves the performance of long-context diffusion policies by 3x and\naccelerates policy training by more than 10x."}

However, while these policies\nachieve strong mean performance across a variety of tasks, they often\nunderperform on individual, specialized tasks and require further tuning on\nnewly acquired task-specific data. Combining task-specific data with carefully\ncurated subsets of large prior datasets via co-training can produce better\nspecialized policies, but selecting data naively may actually harm downstream\nperformance. To address this, we introduce DataMIL, a policy-driven data\nselection framework built on the datamodels paradigm that reasons about data\nselection in an end-to-end manner, using the policy itself to identify which\ndata points will most improve performance. Unlike standard practices that\nfilter data using human notions of quality (e.g., based on semantic or visual\nsimilarity), DataMIL directly optimizes data selection for task success,\nallowing us to select data that enhance the policy while dropping data that\ndegrade it. To avoid performing expensive rollouts in the environment during\nselection, we use a novel surrogate loss function on task-specific data,\nallowing us to use DataMIL in the real world without degrading performance. We\nvalidate our approach on a suite of more than 60 simulation and real-world\nmanipulation tasks - most notably showing successful data selection from the\nOpen X-Embodiment datasets-demonstrating consistent gains in success rates and\nsuperior performance over multiple baselines.

We show that combining function\napproximation with a learned reward model enables agents to generalize from\nmonitored states with observable rewards, to unmonitored environment states\nwith unobservable rewards. Therefore, we demonstrate that such generalization\nwith a reward model achieves near-optimal policies in environments formally\ndefined as unsolvable. However, we identify a critical limitation of such\nfunction approximation, where agents incorrectly extrapolate rewards due to\novergeneralization, resulting in undesirable behaviors. To mitigate\novergeneralization, we propose a cautious police optimization method leveraging\nreward uncertainty. This work serves as a step towards bridging this gap\nbetween Mon-MDP theory and real-world applications."}

Specifically, LMs assign significantly higher\nlogits (or probabilities) to any tokens that have previously appeared in the\ncontext prompt, even for random tokens. This suggests that contextual\nentrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, occurring independently of the\nrelevance or semantic relation of the tokens to the question or the rest of the\nsentence. We find statistically significant evidence that the magnitude of\ncontextual entrainment is influenced by semantic factors. Counterfactual\nprompts have a greater effect compared to factual ones, suggesting that while\ncontextual entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, it is modulated by semantic\nfactors.\n  We hypothesise that there is a circuit of attention heads -- the entrainment\nheads -- that corresponds to the contextual entrainment phenomenon. Using a\nnovel entrainment head discovery method based on differentiable masking, we\nidentify these heads across various settings. When we ``turn off'' these heads,\ni.e., set their outputs to zero, the effect of contextual entrainment is\nsignificantly attenuated, causing the model to generate output that capitulates\nto what it would produce if no distracting context were provided. Our discovery\nof contextual entrainment, along with our investigation into LM distraction via\nthe entrainment heads, marks a key step towards the mechanistic analysis and\nmitigation of the distraction problem."}

To address this, we introduce\nWorldView-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Global Cultural Inclusivity\n(GCI) in LLMs by analyzing their ability to accommodate diverse worldviews. Our\napproach is grounded in the Multiplex Worldview proposed by Senturk et al.,\nwhich distinguishes between Uniplex models, reinforcing cultural\nhomogenization, and Multiplex models, which integrate diverse perspectives.\nWorldView-Bench measures Cultural Polarization, the exclusion of alternative\nperspectives, through free-form generative evaluation rather than conventional\ncategorical benchmarks. We implement applied multiplexity through two\nintervention strategies: (1) Contextually-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, where\nsystem prompts embed multiplexity principles, and (2) Multi-Agent System\n(MAS)-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, where multiple LLM agents representing\ndistinct cultural perspectives collaboratively generate responses. Our results\ndemonstrate a significant increase in Perspectives Distribution Score (PDS)\nentropy from 13% at baseline to 94% with MAS-Implemented Multiplex LLMs,\nalongside a shift toward positive sentiment (67.7%) and enhanced cultural\nbalance.

Then, they utilize sequence-based models (e.g., transformers) to\nencode the temporal evolution of node embeddings, and meta-learning techniques\nto update the model parameters. However, these approaches have two limitations.\nFirst, they neglect the extraction of global and local information\nsimultaneously in each snapshot. Second, they fail to consider the model's\nperformance in the current snapshot during parameter updates, resulting in a\nlack of temporal dependency management. Recently, HiPPO (High-order Polynomial\nProjection Operators) algorithm has gained attention for their ability to\noptimize and preserve sequence history in State Space Model (SSM). To address\nthe aforementioned limitations in dynamic graph representation learning, we\npropose a novel method called Multi-view Dynamic Graph Embeddings with State\nSpace Model Gradient Update (DyGSSM).

There has been considerable discussion about the use of\nLLMs in RTL specifications of chip designs, for which the two most popular\nlanguages are Verilog and VHDL. LLMs and their use in Verilog design has\nreceived significant attention due to the higher popularity of the language,\nbut little attention so far has been given to VHDL despite its continued\npopularity in the industry. There has also been little discussion about the\nunique needs of organizations that engage in high-performance processor design,\nand techniques to deploy AI solutions in these settings. In this paper, we\ndescribe our journey in developing a Large Language Model (LLM) specifically\nfor the purpose of explaining VHDL code, a task that has particular importance\nin an organization with decades of experience and assets in high-performance\nprocessor design. We show how we developed test sets specific to our needs and\nused them for evaluating models as we performed extended pretraining (EPT) of a\nbase LLM. Expert evaluation of the code explanations produced by the EPT model\nincreased to 69% compared to a base model rating of 43%. We further show how we\ndeveloped an LLM-as-a-judge to gauge models similar to expert evaluators. This\nled us to deriving and evaluating a host of new models, including an\ninstruction-tuned version of the EPT model with an expected expert evaluator\nrating of 71%. Our experiments also indicate that with the potential use of\nnewer base models, this rating can be pushed to 85% and beyond.

Second, there are many\ndistinct ways of measuring both the accuracy and fairness of a predictive\nalgorithm; here too, there are no obvious guidelines on how to aggregate our\npreferences for predictive algorithms that satisfy disparate measures of\nfairness and accuracy to various extents. The goal of this paper is to address\nthese challenges by arguing that there are good reasons for using a linear\ncombination of accuracy and fairness metrics to measure the\nall-things-considered value of a predictive algorithm for agents who care about\nboth accuracy and fairness. My argument depends crucially on a classic result\nin the preference aggregation literature due to Harsanyi. After making this\nformal argument, I apply my result to an analysis of accuracy-fairness\ntrade-offs using the COMPAS dataset compiled by Angwin et al."}

This holds a great potential\nnot only for hardware design, but also for various video streaming platforms\nand applications, especially video conferencing applications such as MS-Teams\nor Zoom that have found extensive usage in classrooms and workplaces. However,\ntheir high computational demands currently limit their use in real-time\napplications like video conferencing. To address this, we propose a\nregion-of-interest (ROI) based neural video compression model that leverages 2D\nGaussian Splatting. Unlike traditional codecs, 2D Gaussian Splatting is capable\nof real-time decoding and can be optimized using fewer data points, requiring\nonly thousands of Gaussians for decent quality outputs as opposed to millions\nin 3D scenes. In this work, we designed a video pipeline that speeds up the\nencoding time of the previous Gaussian splatting-based image codec by 88% by\nusing a content-aware initialization strategy paired with a novel Gaussian\ninter-frame redundancy-reduction mechanism, enabling Gaussian splatting to be\nused for a video-codec solution, the first of its kind solution in this neural\nvideo codec space."}

SAGE builds upon the DDIM\nalgorithm and incorporates a novel guidance mechanism utilizing the\nself-attention layers of the diffusion U-Net. This mechanism computes a\nreconstruction objective based on attention maps generated during the inverse\nDDIM process, enabling efficient reconstruction of unedited regions without the\nneed to precisely reconstruct the entire input image. Thus, SAGE directly\naddresses the key challenges in image editing. The superiority of SAGE over\nother methods is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative evaluations\nand confirmed by a statistically validated comprehensive user study, in which\nall 47 surveyed users preferred SAGE over competing methods. Additionally, SAGE\nranks as the top-performing method in seven out of 10 quantitative analyses and\nsecures second and third places in the remaining three."}

As context length increases, training\nbecomes increasingly expensive due to rising memory demands, and policy\nperformance often degrades as a result of spurious correlations. Recent methods\ntypically sidestep these issues by truncating context length, discarding\nhistorical information that may be critical for subsequent decisions. In this\npaper, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly regularizes the\nretention of past information. We first revisit the copycat problem in\nimitation learning and identify an opposite challenge in recent diffusion\npolicies: rather than over-relying on prior actions, they often fail to capture\nessential dependencies between past and future actions. To address this, we\nintroduce Past-Token Prediction (PTP), an auxiliary task in which the policy\nlearns to predict past action tokens alongside future ones. This regularization\nsignificantly improves temporal modeling in the policy head, with minimal\nreliance on visual representations. Building on this observation, we further\nintroduce a multistage training strategy: pre-train the visual encoder with\nshort contexts, and fine-tune the policy head using cached long-context\nembeddings. This strategy preserves the benefits of PTP while greatly reducing\nmemory and computational overhead.

Yet, learning effective long-context policies from\ndemonstrations remains challenging. As context length increases, training\nbecomes increasingly expensive due to rising memory demands, and policy\nperformance often degrades as a result of spurious correlations. Recent methods\ntypically sidestep these issues by truncating context length, discarding\nhistorical information that may be critical for subsequent decisions. In this\npaper, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly regularizes the\nretention of past information. We first revisit the copycat problem in\nimitation learning and identify an opposite challenge in recent diffusion\npolicies: rather than over-relying on prior actions, they often fail to capture\nessential dependencies between past and future actions. To address this, we\nintroduce Past-Token Prediction (PTP), an auxiliary task in which the policy\nlearns to predict past action tokens alongside future ones. This regularization\nsignificantly improves temporal modeling in the policy head, with minimal\nreliance on visual representations. Building on this observation, we further\nintroduce a multistage training strategy: pre-train the visual encoder with\nshort contexts, and fine-tune the policy head using cached long-context\nembeddings. This strategy preserves the benefits of PTP while greatly reducing\nmemory and computational overhead. Finally, we extend PTP into a\nself-verification mechanism at test time, enabling the policy to score and\nselect candidates consistent with past actions during inference.

However, while these policies\nachieve strong mean performance across a variety of tasks, they often\nunderperform on individual, specialized tasks and require further tuning on\nnewly acquired task-specific data. Combining task-specific data with carefully\ncurated subsets of large prior datasets via co-training can produce better\nspecialized policies, but selecting data naively may actually harm downstream\nperformance. To address this, we introduce DataMIL, a policy-driven data\nselection framework built on the datamodels paradigm that reasons about data\nselection in an end-to-end manner, using the policy itself to identify which\ndata points will most improve performance. Unlike standard practices that\nfilter data using human notions of quality (e.g., based on semantic or visual\nsimilarity), DataMIL directly optimizes data selection for task success,\nallowing us to select data that enhance the policy while dropping data that\ndegrade it. To avoid performing expensive rollouts in the environment during\nselection, we use a novel surrogate loss function on task-specific data,\nallowing us to use DataMIL in the real world without degrading performance. We\nvalidate our approach on a suite of more than 60 simulation and real-world\nmanipulation tasks - most notably showing successful data selection from the\nOpen X-Embodiment datasets-demonstrating consistent gains in success rates and\nsuperior performance over multiple baselines.

While traditional category learning models represent each\nexample as an unstructured feature vector, compositional concept learning is\nthought to depend on (1) structured representations of examples (e.g., directed\ngraphs consisting of objects and their relations) and (2) the identification of\nshared relational structure across examples through analogical mapping. Here,\nwe introduce Probabilistic Schema Induction (PSI), a prototype model that\nemploys deep learning to perform analogical mapping over structured\nrepresentations of only a handful of examples, forming a compositional concept\ncalled a schema. In doing so, PSI relies on a novel conception of similarity\nthat weighs object-level similarity and relational similarity, as well as a\nmechanism for amplifying relations relevant to classification, analogous to\nselective attention parameters in traditional models. We show that PSI produces\nhuman-like learning performance and outperforms two controls: a prototype model\nthat uses unstructured feature vectors extracted from a deep learning model,\nand a variant of PSI with weaker structured representations. Notably, we find\nthat PSI's human-like performance is driven by an adaptive strategy that\nincreases relational similarity over object-level similarity and upweights the\ncontribution of relations that distinguish classes.

In the typical setup for unsupervised domain adaptation,\nlabeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a target domain are\nused to train a target model. However, access to labeled source domain data,\nparticularly in medical datasets, can be restricted due to privacy policies. As\na result, research has increasingly shifted to source-free domain adaptation\n(SFDA), which requires only a pretrained model from the source domain and\nunlabeled data from the target domain data for adaptation. Existing SFDA\nmethods often rely on domain-specific image style translation and\nself-supervision techniques to bridge the domain gap and train the target\ndomain model. However, the quality of domain-specific style-translated images\nand pseudo-labels produced by these methods still leaves room for improvement.\nMoreover, training the entire model during adaptation can be inefficient under\nlimited supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel SFDA framework to\naddress these challenges.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose a Graph RAG pipeline that leverages Educational\nKnowledge Graphs (EduKGs) and Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) to guide\nlearners to understand knowledge concepts in the MOOC platform CourseMapper.\nSpecifically, we implement (1) a PKG-based Question Generation method to\nrecommend personalized questions for learners in context, and (2) an\nEduKG-based Question Answering method that leverages the relationships between\nknowledge concepts in the EduKG to answer learner selected questions. To\nevaluate both methods, we conducted a study with 3 expert instructors on 3\ndifferent MOOCs in the MOOC platform CourseMapper. The results of the\nevaluation show the potential of Graph RAG to empower learners to understand\nnew knowledge concepts in a personalized learning experience."}

The LLM predicts logits over this compact codebook,\nwhich are then efficiently \"scattered\" to the full vocabulary space using the\nlearned or preassigned mapping. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on\nstandard language modeling benchmarks (e.g., WikiText-103, C4) that VQ-Logits\ncan achieve up to 99% parameter reduction in the output layer and 6x speedup in\nlogit computation, with only a marginal 4% increase in perplexity compared to\nfull softmax baselines.

MMRL generates space tokens projected\ninto both text and image encoders as representation tokens, enabling more\neffective cross-modal interactions. Unlike prior methods that mainly optimize\nclass token features, MMRL inserts representation tokens into higher encoder\nlayers--where task-specific features are more prominent--while preserving\ngeneral knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both class and\nrepresentation features are jointly optimized: a trainable projection layer is\napplied to representation tokens for task adaptation, while the projection\nlayer for class token remains frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. To\nfurther promote generalization, we introduce a regularization term aligning\nclass and text features with the frozen VLM's zero-shot features. At inference,\na decoupling strategy uses both class and representation features for base\ntasks, but only class features for novel tasks due to their stronger\ngeneralization.

To bridge this gap, we introduce ImagineBench,\nthe first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating offline RL algorithms that\nleverage both real rollouts and LLM-imaginary rollouts. The key features of\nImagineBench include: (1) datasets comprising environment-collected and\nLLM-imaginary rollouts; (2) diverse domains of environments covering\nlocomotion, robotic manipulation, and navigation tasks; and (3) natural\nlanguage task instructions with varying complexity levels to facilitate\nlanguage-conditioned policy learning.

This process is time-consuming\nand prone to errors, limiting the efficiency of data-driven approaches in\nhealthcare. To address these challenges, Natural Language Processing (NLP)\noffers an alternative for automating the extraction of relevant data from\nelectronic health records (EHRs). In this study, we focus on lung and breast\ncancer due to their high incidence and the significant impact they have on\npublic health. Early detection and effective data management in both types of\ncancer are crucial for improving patient outcomes. To enhance the accuracy and\nefficiency of data extraction, we utilized GMV's NLP tool uQuery, which excels\nat identifying relevant entities in clinical texts and converting them into\nstandardized formats such as SNOMED and OMOP. uQuery not only detects and\nclassifies entities but also associates them with contextual information,\nincluding negated entities, temporal aspects, and patient-related details. In\nthis work, we explore the use of NLP techniques, specifically Named Entity\nRecognition (NER), to automatically identify and extract key clinical\ninformation from EHRs related to these two cancers. A dataset from Health\nResearch Institute Hospital La Fe (IIS La Fe), comprising 200 annotated breast\ncancer and 400 lung cancer reports, was used, with eight clinical entities\nmanually labeled using the Doccano platform. To perform NER, we fine-tuned the\nbsc-bio-ehr-en3 model, a RoBERTa-based biomedical linguistic model pre-trained\nin Spanish. Fine-tuning was performed using the Transformers architecture,\nenabling accurate recognition of clinical entities in these cancer types. Our\nresults demonstrate strong overall performance, particularly in identifying\nentities like MET and PAT, although challenges remain with less frequent\nentities like EVOL."}

To better understand the\ninterplay between these learning modes, we draw inspiration from evolutionary\nbiology's analogous adaptive strategies: genetic encoding (akin to IWL,\nadapting over generations and fixed within an individual's lifetime) and\nphenotypic plasticity (akin to ICL, enabling flexible behavioral responses to\nenvironmental cues). In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability\ndictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic\nencoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We\nexperimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and\nsystematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in\nTransformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high\nenvironmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp\ntransition at maximal stability. Conversely, high cue reliability enhances ICL\nefficacy, particularly when stability is low. Furthermore, learning dynamics\nreveal task-contingent temporal evolution: while a canonical ICL-to-IWL shift\noccurs in some settings (e.g., classification with many classes), we\ndemonstrate that scenarios with easier IWL (e.g., fewer classes) or slower ICL\nacquisition (e.g., regression) can exhibit an initial IWL phase later yielding\nto ICL dominance.

However, the origin of this\nneural scaling law -- the finding that loss decreases as a power law with model\nsize -- remains unclear. Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs\nrepresent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,\nrepresentations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur\nwith varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss\nscaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only\nthe most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of\nloss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature\nfrequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong\nsuperposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,\nthe loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide\nrange of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is\nexplained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower\ndimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales\ninversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced\nLLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match\nthe predictions of our toy model.

Through our analysis, we decouple the\nvisual and textual modalities within the causal attention module, revealing\nthat attention distribution increasingly converges on the image associated with\nthe correct answer as the network layers deepen. This insight leads to the\nintroduction of a scale-agnostic metric, \\textit{attention accuracy}, and a\nnovel benchmark for quantifying IVMs. Attention accuracy directly evaluates the\nmodel's visual understanding via internal mechanisms, remaining robust to\npositional biases for more reliable assessments.

We apply $P$ diverse and\nlearnable transformations to the input, execute forward passes of the model in\nparallel, and dynamically aggregate the $P$ outputs. This method, namely\nparallel scaling (ParScale), scales parallel computation by reusing existing\nparameters and can be applied to any model structure, optimization procedure,\ndata, or task. We theoretically propose a new scaling law and validate it\nthrough large-scale pre-training, which shows that a model with $P$ parallel\nstreams is similar to scaling the parameters by $O(\\log P)$ while showing\nsuperior inference efficiency. For example, ParScale can use up to 22$\\times$\nless memory increase and 6$\\times$ less latency increase compared to parameter\nscaling that achieves the same performance improvement.

A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is\nconceived, where the time horizon includes multiple charging and operating\nperiods in a day, while each period is further divided into multiple time\nsteps. To overcome the challenge of long-range multi-phase planning with sparse\nreward, we conceive Hierarchical DRL (HDRL) for decoupling the original MDP\ninto a high-level Semi-MDP (SMDP) and multiple low-level MDPs. The Hierarchical\nDouble Deep Q-Network (HDDQN)-Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) algorithm is\nproposed for simultaneously solving the decision problems arising at different\ntemporal resolutions. As a result, the high-level agent learns an effective\npolicy for prescribing the charging targets for every charging period, while\nthe low-level agent learns an optimal policy for setting the charging power of\nevery time step within a single charging period, with the aim of minimizing the\ncharging costs while meeting the charging target.

However,\ndiffusion models still routinely generate images that would not exist in\nreality, such as a dog floating above the ground or with unrealistic texture\nartifacts. We define the concept of feasibility as whether attributes in a\nsynthetic image could realistically exist in the real-world domain; synthetic\nimages containing attributes that violate this criterion are considered\ninfeasible. Intuitively, infeasible images are typically considered\nout-of-distribution; thus, training on such images is expected to hinder a\nmodel's ability to generalize to real-world data, and they should therefore be\nexcluded from the training set whenever possible. However, does feasibility\nreally matter? In this paper, we investigate whether enforcing feasibility is\nnecessary when generating synthetic training data for CLIP-based classifiers,\nfocusing on three target attributes: background, color, and texture. We\nintroduce VariReal, a pipeline that minimally edits a given source image to\ninclude feasible or infeasible attributes given by the textual prompt generated\nby a large language model. Our experiments show that feasibility minimally\naffects LoRA-fine-tuned CLIP performance, with mostly less than 0.3% difference\nin top-1 accuracy across three fine-grained datasets.

Interestingly, for the case in which samples are generated by\na Gaussian distribution and labels are constructed by employing a teacher\nperceptron, we analytically prove and numerically confirm that such optimal\ntemperature does not depend neither on the teacher classifier (which is, by\nconstruction of the learning problem, unknown), nor on the number of random\nclassifiers, highlighting the universal nature of the observed behavior.\nExperiments on the MNIST dataset underline the relevance of this phenomenon in\nhigh-quality, noiseless, datasets. Finally, a physical analogy allows us to\nshed light on the self-organizing nature of the studied phenomenon."}

Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs\nrepresent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,\nrepresentations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur\nwith varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss\nscaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only\nthe most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of\nloss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature\nfrequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong\nsuperposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,\nthe loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide\nrange of feature frequency distributions.

Specifically, we examine two model families (GPT and\nLlama) across multiple sizes, focusing on one of the most widely used dataset\nin recommender systems: MovieLens-1M.

Such transitions are often discussed through the framework of\nbifurcation theory, but the spatial patterning of vegetation, which is\ncharacteristic of drylands, leads to dynamics that are much more complex and\ndiverse than local bifurcations. Recent methodological developments in Early\nWarning Signal (EWS) detection have shown promise in identifying dynamical\nsignatures of oncoming critical transitions, with particularly strong\npredictive capabilities being demonstrated by deep neural networks. However, a\nmachine learning model trained on synthetic examples is only useful if it can\neffectively transfer to a test case of practical interest. These models'\ncapacity to generalize in this manner has been demonstrated for bifurcation\ntransitions, but it is not as well characterized for high-dimensional phase\ntransitions. This paper explores the successes and shortcomings of neural EWS\ndetection for spatially patterned phase transitions, and shows how these models\ncan be used to gain insight into where and how EWS-relevant information is\nencoded in spatiotemporal dynamics.

Rather than using a safety\ncertifier to myopically intervene with the RL controller, a risk-informed safe\ncontroller is also learned besides the RL controller, and the RL and safe\ncontrollers are combined together. Several advantages come along with this\napproach: 1) High-confidence safety can be certified without relying on a\nhigh-fidelity system model and using limited data available, 2) Myopic\ninterventions and convergence to an undesired equilibrium can be avoided by\ndeciding on the contribution of two stabilizing controllers, and 3) highly\nefficient and computationally tractable solutions can be provided by optimizing\nover a scalar decision variable and linear programming polyhedral sets. To\nlearn safe controllers with a large invariant set, piecewise affine controllers\nare learned instead of linear controllers. To this end, the closed-loop system\nis first represented using collected data, a decision variable, and noise. The\neffect of the decision variable on the variance of the safe violation of the\nclosed-loop system is formalized. The decision variable is then designed such\nthat the probability of safety violation for the learned closed-loop system is\nminimized. It is shown that this control-oriented approach reduces the data\nrequirements and can also reduce the variance of safety violations. Finally, to\nintegrate the safe and RL controllers, a new data-driven interpolation\ntechnique is introduced. This method aims to maintain the RL agent's optimal\nimplementation while ensuring its safety within environments characterized by\nnoise.

Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs\nrepresent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,\nrepresentations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur\nwith varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss\nscaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only\nthe most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of\nloss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature\nfrequencies follow a power law, so does the loss.

This robust scaling behavior is\nexplained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower\ndimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales\ninversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced\nLLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match\nthe predictions of our toy model.

However,\ndiffusion models still routinely generate images that would not exist in\nreality, such as a dog floating above the ground or with unrealistic texture\nartifacts. We define the concept of feasibility as whether attributes in a\nsynthetic image could realistically exist in the real-world domain; synthetic\nimages containing attributes that violate this criterion are considered\ninfeasible. Intuitively, infeasible images are typically considered\nout-of-distribution; thus, training on such images is expected to hinder a\nmodel's ability to generalize to real-world data, and they should therefore be\nexcluded from the training set whenever possible. However, does feasibility\nreally matter? In this paper, we investigate whether enforcing feasibility is\nnecessary when generating synthetic training data for CLIP-based classifiers,\nfocusing on three target attributes: background, color, and texture. We\nintroduce VariReal, a pipeline that minimally edits a given source image to\ninclude feasible or infeasible attributes given by the textual prompt generated\nby a large language model.

By\nconditioning the normalizing flow on temperature, we leverage overparameterized\nneural networks' generalization capabilities to train a single flow\nrepresenting the posterior across a range of temperatures. This preserves modes\nidentified at higher temperatures when sampling from the variational posterior\nat $T = 1$, mitigating standard variational methods' mode-seeking behavior. In\nexperiments with 2, 10, and 20 dimensional multi-modal distributions, FlowVAT\noutperforms traditional and adaptive annealing methods, finding more modes and\nachieving better ELBO values, particularly in higher dimensions where existing\napproaches fail. Our method requires minimal hyperparameter tuning and does not\nrequire an annealing schedule, advancing toward fully-automatic black-box\nvariational inference for complicated posteriors."}

Recent developments in\ngraph unlearning methods have primarily focused on maintaining model prediction\nperformance while removing user information. However, we have observed that\nwhen user information is deleted from the model, the prediction distribution\nacross different sensitive groups often changes. Furthermore, graph models are\nshown to be prone to amplifying biases, making the study of fairness in graph\nunlearning particularly important. This raises the question: Does graph\nunlearning actually introduce bias? Our findings indicate that the predictions\nof post-unlearning models become highly correlated with sensitive attributes,\nconfirming the introduction of bias in the graph unlearning process. To address\nthis issue, we propose a fair graph unlearning method, FGU. To guarantee\nprivacy, FGU trains shard models on partitioned subgraphs, unlearns the\nrequested data from the corresponding subgraphs, and retrains the shard models\non the modified subgraphs. To ensure fairness, FGU employs a bi-level debiasing\nprocess: it first enables shard-level fairness by incorporating a fairness\nregularizer in the shard model retraining, and then achieves global-level\nfairness by aligning all shard models to minimize global disparity. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that FGU achieves superior fairness while maintaining\nprivacy and accuracy.

While traditional category learning models represent each\nexample as an unstructured feature vector, compositional concept learning is\nthought to depend on (1) structured representations of examples (e.g., directed\ngraphs consisting of objects and their relations) and (2) the identification of\nshared relational structure across examples through analogical mapping. Here,\nwe introduce Probabilistic Schema Induction (PSI), a prototype model that\nemploys deep learning to perform analogical mapping over structured\nrepresentations of only a handful of examples, forming a compositional concept\ncalled a schema. In doing so, PSI relies on a novel conception of similarity\nthat weighs object-level similarity and relational similarity, as well as a\nmechanism for amplifying relations relevant to classification, analogous to\nselective attention parameters in traditional models. We show that PSI produces\nhuman-like learning performance and outperforms two controls: a prototype model\nthat uses unstructured feature vectors extracted from a deep learning model,\nand a variant of PSI with weaker structured representations. Notably, we find\nthat PSI's human-like performance is driven by an adaptive strategy that\nincreases relational similarity over object-level similarity and upweights the\ncontribution of relations that distinguish classes. These findings suggest that\nstructured representations and analogical mapping are critical to modeling\nrapid human-like learning of compositional visual concepts, and demonstrate how\ndeep learning can be leveraged to create psychological models."}

In the typical setup for unsupervised domain adaptation,\nlabeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a target domain are\nused to train a target model. However, access to labeled source domain data,\nparticularly in medical datasets, can be restricted due to privacy policies. As\na result, research has increasingly shifted to source-free domain adaptation\n(SFDA), which requires only a pretrained model from the source domain and\nunlabeled data from the target domain data for adaptation. Existing SFDA\nmethods often rely on domain-specific image style translation and\nself-supervision techniques to bridge the domain gap and train the target\ndomain model. However, the quality of domain-specific style-translated images\nand pseudo-labels produced by these methods still leaves room for improvement.\nMoreover, training the entire model during adaptation can be inefficient under\nlimited supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel SFDA framework to\naddress these challenges.

Continuous Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) offers a solution by\nadapting a source-pretrained model to evolving, unlabeled target domains.\nDespite its potential, research on ALS point clouds remains limited, facing\nchallenges such as the absence of standardized datasets and the risk of\ncatastrophic forgetting and error accumulation during prolonged adaptation. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose APCoTTA, the first CTTA method tailored for\nALS point cloud semantic segmentation. We propose a dynamic trainable layer\nselection module. This module utilizes gradient information to select\nlow-confidence layers for training, and the remaining layers are kept frozen,\nmitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further reduce error accumulation, we\npropose an entropy-based consistency loss.

In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability\ndictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic\nencoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We\nexperimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and\nsystematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in\nTransformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high\nenvironmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp\ntransition at maximal stability.

KQT-EWMA\nenables controlling false alarms by operating at a pre-determined Average Run\nLength ($ARL_0$), which measures the expected number of stationary samples to\nbe monitored before triggering a false alarm. The latter peculiarity is in\ncontrast with most non-parametric change-detection tests, which rarely can\ncontrol the $ARL_0$ a priori. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that KQT-EWMA can control $ARL_0$ while achieving\ndetection delays comparable to or lower than state-of-the-art methods designed\nto work in the same conditions."}

Models are far more complex than ever before, growing to\ngargantuan sizes and housing millions of weights. Unfortunately, the fact that\nlarge models have become the state of the art means that it often costs\nmillions of dollars to train and operate them. These expenses not only hurt\ncompanies but also bar non-wealthy individuals from contributing to new\ndevelopments and force consumers to pay greater prices for AI. Current methods\nused to prune models, such as iterative magnitude pruning, have shown great\naccuracy but require an iterative training sequence that is incredibly\ncomputationally and environmentally taxing. To solve this problem, BINGO is\nintroduced. BINGO, during the training pass, studies specific subsets of a\nneural network one at a time to gauge how significant of a role each weight\nplays in contributing to a network's accuracy. By the time training is done,\nBINGO generates a significance score for each weight, allowing for\ninsignificant weights to be pruned in one shot. BINGO provides an\naccuracy-preserving pruning technique that is less computationally intensive\nthan current methods, allowing for a world where AI growth does not have to\nmean model growth, as well."}

To address this, we propose Multi-Modal\nRepresentation Learning (MMRL), which introduces a shared, learnable,\nmodality-agnostic representation space. MMRL generates space tokens projected\ninto both text and image encoders as representation tokens, enabling more\neffective cross-modal interactions. Unlike prior methods that mainly optimize\nclass token features, MMRL inserts representation tokens into higher encoder\nlayers--where task-specific features are more prominent--while preserving\ngeneral knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both class and\nrepresentation features are jointly optimized: a trainable projection layer is\napplied to representation tokens for task adaptation, while the projection\nlayer for class token remains frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. To\nfurther promote generalization, we introduce a regularization term aligning\nclass and text features with the frozen VLM's zero-shot features. At inference,\na decoupling strategy uses both class and representation features for base\ntasks, but only class features for novel tasks due to their stronger\ngeneralization. Building upon this, we propose MMRL++, a parameter-efficient\nand interaction-aware extension that significantly reduces trainable parameters\nand enhances intra-modal interactions--particularly across the layers of\nrepresentation tokens--allowing gradient sharing and instance-specific\ninformation to propagate more effectively through the network.

We assessed PLS quality through\nsubjective Likert-scale ratings focusing on simplicity, informativeness,\ncoherence, and faithfulness; and objective multiple-choice comprehension and\nrecall measures of reader understanding. Additionally, we examined the\nalignment between 10 automated evaluation metrics and human judgments. Our\nfindings indicate that while LLMs can generate PLSs that appear\nindistinguishable from human-written ones in subjective evaluations,\nhuman-written PLSs lead to significantly better comprehension. Furthermore,\nautomated evaluation metrics fail to reflect human judgment, calling into\nquestion their suitability for evaluating PLSs. This is the first study to\nsystematically evaluate LLM-generated PLSs based on both reader preferences and\ncomprehension outcomes. Our findings highlight the need for evaluation\nframeworks that move beyond surface-level quality and for generation methods\nthat explicitly optimize for layperson comprehension."}

Traditional statistical\nmethods and machine learning models often struggle to capture the complex\ninteractions between various factors and the unique characteristics of each\ncrash. This research leverages large language model (LLM) to analyze freeway\ncrash data and provide crash causation analysis accordingly. By compiling 226\ntraffic safety studies related to freeway crashes, a training dataset\nencompassing environmental, driver, traffic, and geometric design factors was\ncreated. The Llama3 8B model was fine-tuned using QLoRA to enhance its\nunderstanding of freeway crashes and their contributing factors, as covered in\nthese studies. The fine-tuned Llama3 8B model was then used to identify crash\ncausation without pre-labeled data through zero-shot classification, providing\ncomprehensive explanations to ensure that the identified causes were reasonable\nand aligned with existing research. Results demonstrate that LLMs effectively\nidentify primary crash causes such as alcohol-impaired driving, speeding,\naggressive driving, and driver inattention. Incorporating event data, such as\nroad maintenance, offers more profound insights.

To better understand the\ninterplay between these learning modes, we draw inspiration from evolutionary\nbiology's analogous adaptive strategies: genetic encoding (akin to IWL,\nadapting over generations and fixed within an individual's lifetime) and\nphenotypic plasticity (akin to ICL, enabling flexible behavioral responses to\nenvironmental cues). In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability\ndictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic\nencoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We\nexperimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and\nsystematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in\nTransformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high\nenvironmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp\ntransition at maximal stability. Conversely, high cue reliability enhances ICL\nefficacy, particularly when stability is low. Furthermore, learning dynamics\nreveal task-contingent temporal evolution: while a canonical ICL-to-IWL shift\noccurs in some settings (e.g., classification with many classes), we\ndemonstrate that scenarios with easier IWL (e.g., fewer classes) or slower ICL\nacquisition (e.g., regression) can exhibit an initial IWL phase later yielding\nto ICL dominance.

Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs\nrepresent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,\nrepresentations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur\nwith varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss\nscaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only\nthe most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of\nloss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature\nfrequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong\nsuperposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,\nthe loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide\nrange of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is\nexplained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower\ndimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales\ninversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced\nLLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match\nthe predictions of our toy model.

We apply $P$ diverse and\nlearnable transformations to the input, execute forward passes of the model in\nparallel, and dynamically aggregate the $P$ outputs.

One of\nthe root causes of such problems is the lack of timely, factual, and\npersonalized information fed to the LLM. In this paper, we propose an approach\nto address these problems by introducing retrieval augmented generation (RAG)\nusing knowledge graphs (KGs) to assist the LLM in personalized response\ngeneration tailored to the users. KGs have the advantage of storing\ncontinuously updated factual information in a structured way.

To address these\nissues, we develop a hybrid Gen-SemCom system with a critical information\nembedding (CIE) framework, where both text prompts and semantically critical\nfeatures are extracted for transmissions. First, a novel approach of semantic\nfiltering is proposed to select and transmit the semantically critical features\nof images relevant to semantic label. By integrating the text prompt and\ncritical features, the receiver reconstructs high-fidelity images using a\ndiffusion-based generative model. Next, we propose the generative visual\ninformation fidelity (GVIF) metric to evaluate the visual quality of the\ngenerated image. By characterizing the statistical models of image features,\nthe GVIF metric quantifies the mutual information between the distorted\nfeatures and their original counterparts. By maximizing the GVIF metric, we\ndesign a channel-adaptive Gen-SemCom system that adaptively control the volume\nof features and compression rate according to the channel state.

Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs\nrepresent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,\nrepresentations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur\nwith varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss\nscaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only\nthe most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of\nloss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature\nfrequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong\nsuperposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,\nthe loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide\nrange of feature frequency distributions.

To question the applicability of the scaling law\nin time series forecasting, we propose Alinear, an ultra-lightweight\nforecasting model that achieves competitive performance using only k-level\nparameters. We introduce a horizon-aware adaptive decomposition mechanism that\ndynamically rebalances component emphasis across different forecast lengths,\nalongside a progressive frequency attenuation strategy that achieves stable\nprediction in various forecasting horizons without incurring the computational\noverhead of attention mechanisms.

Rather than using a safety\ncertifier to myopically intervene with the RL controller, a risk-informed safe\ncontroller is also learned besides the RL controller, and the RL and safe\ncontrollers are combined together. Several advantages come along with this\napproach: 1) High-confidence safety can be certified without relying on a\nhigh-fidelity system model and using limited data available, 2) Myopic\ninterventions and convergence to an undesired equilibrium can be avoided by\ndeciding on the contribution of two stabilizing controllers, and 3) highly\nefficient and computationally tractable solutions can be provided by optimizing\nover a scalar decision variable and linear programming polyhedral sets. To\nlearn safe controllers with a large invariant set, piecewise affine controllers\nare learned instead of linear controllers. To this end, the closed-loop system\nis first represented using collected data, a decision variable, and noise. The\neffect of the decision variable on the variance of the safe violation of the\nclosed-loop system is formalized. The decision variable is then designed such\nthat the probability of safety violation for the learned closed-loop system is\nminimized. It is shown that this control-oriented approach reduces the data\nrequirements and can also reduce the variance of safety violations.

Meanwhile in numerous practical applications, e.g. in robotics, taking\ninto account the agents' sizes is vital to ensure that the MAPF solutions can\nbe safely executed. Introducing large agents yields an additional type of\nconflict arising when one agent follows an edge and its body overlaps with the\nbody of another agent that is actually not using this same edge (e.g. staying\nstill at some distinct vertex of the graph).

While traditional category learning models represent each\nexample as an unstructured feature vector, compositional concept learning is\nthought to depend on (1) structured representations of examples (e.g., directed\ngraphs consisting of objects and their relations) and (2) the identification of\nshared relational structure across examples through analogical mapping. Here,\nwe introduce Probabilistic Schema Induction (PSI), a prototype model that\nemploys deep learning to perform analogical mapping over structured\nrepresentations of only a handful of examples, forming a compositional concept\ncalled a schema. In doing so, PSI relies on a novel conception of similarity\nthat weighs object-level similarity and relational similarity, as well as a\nmechanism for amplifying relations relevant to classification, analogous to\nselective attention parameters in traditional models. We show that PSI produces\nhuman-like learning performance and outperforms two controls: a prototype model\nthat uses unstructured feature vectors extracted from a deep learning model,\nand a variant of PSI with weaker structured representations. Notably, we find\nthat PSI's human-like performance is driven by an adaptive strategy that\nincreases relational similarity over object-level similarity and upweights the\ncontribution of relations that distinguish classes. These findings suggest that\nstructured representations and analogical mapping are critical to modeling\nrapid human-like learning of compositional visual concepts, and demonstrate how\ndeep learning can be leveraged to create psychological models."}

In the typical setup for unsupervised domain adaptation,\nlabeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a target domain are\nused to train a target model.

As\na result, research has increasingly shifted to source-free domain adaptation\n(SFDA), which requires only a pretrained model from the source domain and\nunlabeled data from the target domain data for adaptation. Existing SFDA\nmethods often rely on domain-specific image style translation and\nself-supervision techniques to bridge the domain gap and train the target\ndomain model.

Using synthetic data\nfor successive training of future model generations creates \"self-consuming\nloops\", which may lead to model collapse or training instability. Furthermore,\nsynthetic data is often subject to human feedback and curated by users based on\ntheir preferences. Ferbach et al. (2024) recently showed that when data is\ncurated according to user preferences, the self-consuming retraining loop\ndrives the model to converge toward a distribution that optimizes those\npreferences. However, in practice, data curation is often noisy or\nadversarially manipulated. For example, competing platforms may recruit\nmalicious users to adversarially curate data and disrupt rival models. In this\npaper, we study how generative models evolve under self-consuming retraining\nloops with noisy and adversarially curated data.

However, alongside their remarkable\ncapabilities lies a significant threat: the susceptibility of these models to\njailbreaking. The fundamental vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks stems\nfrom the very data they learn from. As long as this training data includes\nunfiltered, problematic, or 'dark' content, the models can inherently learn\nundesirable patterns or weaknesses that allow users to circumvent their\nintended safety controls. Our research identifies the growing threat posed by\ndark LLMs models deliberately designed without ethical guardrails or modified\nthrough jailbreak techniques.

However, recent empirical work has shown that humans vary\nenormously in what they consider commonsensical; thus what appears self-evident\nto one benchmark designer may not be so to another. Here, we propose a novel\nmethod for evaluating common sense in artificial intelligence (AI),\nspecifically in large language models (LLMs), that incorporates empirically\nobserved heterogeneity among humans by measuring the correspondence between a\nmodel's judgment and that of a human population. We first find that, when\ntreated as independent survey respondents, most LLMs remain below the human\nmedian in their individual commonsense competence.

While existing paradigms like federated learning (FL) and\ndecentralized FL (DFL) enable privacy-preserving distributed learning in many\nscenarios, they face potential challenges in connectivity and synchronization\nimposed by resource-constrained and infrastructure-less environments. While\nmore robust, gossip learning (GL) algorithms have generally been designed for\nhomogeneous data distributions and may not suit all contexts. This paper\nintroduces Chisme, a novel suite of protocols designed to address the\nchallenges of implementing robust intelligence in the network edge,\ncharacterized by heterogeneous data distributions, episodic connectivity, and\nlack of infrastructure. Chisme includes both synchronous DFL (Chisme-DFL) and\nasynchronous GL (Chisme-GL) variants that enable collaborative yet\ndecentralized model training that considers underlying data heterogeneity. We\nintroduce a data similarity heuristic that allows agents to opportunistically\ninfer affinity with each other using the existing communication of model\nupdates in decentralized FL and GL. We leverage the heuristic to extend DFL's\nmodel aggregation and GL's model merge mechanisms for better personalized\ntraining while maintaining collaboration. While Chisme-DFL is a synchronous\ndecentralized approach whose resource utilization scales linearly with network\nsize, Chisme-GL is fully asynchronous and has a lower, constant resource\nrequirement independent of network size. We demonstrate that Chisme methods\noutperform their standard counterparts in model training over distributed and\nheterogeneous data in network scenarios ranging from less connected and\nreliable networks to fully connected and lossless networks."}

To better understand the\ninterplay between these learning modes, we draw inspiration from evolutionary\nbiology's analogous adaptive strategies: genetic encoding (akin to IWL,\nadapting over generations and fixed within an individual's lifetime) and\nphenotypic plasticity (akin to ICL, enabling flexible behavioral responses to\nenvironmental cues). In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability\ndictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic\nencoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We\nexperimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and\nsystematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in\nTransformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high\nenvironmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp\ntransition at maximal stability.

MMRL generates space tokens projected\ninto both text and image encoders as representation tokens, enabling more\neffective cross-modal interactions. Unlike prior methods that mainly optimize\nclass token features, MMRL inserts representation tokens into higher encoder\nlayers--where task-specific features are more prominent--while preserving\ngeneral knowledge in the lower layers.

First, we choose SEDD as a representative continuous-time discrete\ndiffusion model, where its concrete score derives a probabilistic policy to\nmaximize the RL reward over the entire sequence of intermediate diffusion\nsteps. We further consider the discrete-time masked diffusion language model --\nLLaDA, and find that the order to predict and unmask tokens plays an essential\nrole to optimize its RL action resulting from the ranking-based Unmasking\nPolicy Module (UPM) defined by the Plackett-Luce model. Experiments on both\nmath and code generation tasks show that using only public data and 16 H800\nGPUs, DCoLT-reinforced DLMs outperform other DLMs trained by SFT or RL or even\nboth. Notably, DCoLT-reinforced LLaDA boosts its reasoning accuracy by +9.8%,\n+5.7%, +11.4%, +19.5% on GSM8K, MATH, MBPP, and HumanEval."}

Specifically, we introduce 4DMoT\n(4D motion tokenizer) to quantize 3D motion sequences into 4D motion tokens.\nCompared to 2D-rendered pose images, 4D motion tokens offer more robust\nspatio-temporal cues and avoid strict pixel-level alignment between pose image\nand character, enabling more flexible and disentangled control. Then, we\nintroduce MV-DiT (Motion-aware Video DiT). By designing unique motion attention\nwith 4D positional encodings, MV-DiT can effectively leverage motion tokens as\n4D compact yet expressive context for human image animation in the complex 3D\nworld.

To better understand the\ninterplay between these learning modes, we draw inspiration from evolutionary\nbiology's analogous adaptive strategies: genetic encoding (akin to IWL,\nadapting over generations and fixed within an individual's lifetime) and\nphenotypic plasticity (akin to ICL, enabling flexible behavioral responses to\nenvironmental cues). In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability\ndictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic\nencoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We\nexperimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and\nsystematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in\nTransformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high\nenvironmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp\ntransition at maximal stability. Conversely, high cue reliability enhances ICL\nefficacy, particularly when stability is low. Furthermore, learning dynamics\nreveal task-contingent temporal evolution: while a canonical ICL-to-IWL shift\noccurs in some settings (e.g., classification with many classes), we\ndemonstrate that scenarios with easier IWL (e.g., fewer classes) or slower ICL\nacquisition (e.g., regression) can exhibit an initial IWL phase later yielding\nto ICL dominance.

In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability\ndictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic\nencoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We\nexperimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and\nsystematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in\nTransformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high\nenvironmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp\ntransition at maximal stability. Conversely, high cue reliability enhances ICL\nefficacy, particularly when stability is low. Furthermore, learning dynamics\nreveal task-contingent temporal evolution: while a canonical ICL-to-IWL shift\noccurs in some settings (e.g., classification with many classes), we\ndemonstrate that scenarios with easier IWL (e.g., fewer classes) or slower ICL\nacquisition (e.g., regression) can exhibit an initial IWL phase later yielding\nto ICL dominance.

The fine-tuned Llama3 8B model was then used to identify crash\ncausation without pre-labeled data through zero-shot classification, providing\ncomprehensive explanations to ensure that the identified causes were reasonable\nand aligned with existing research. Results demonstrate that LLMs effectively\nidentify primary crash causes such as alcohol-impaired driving, speeding,\naggressive driving, and driver inattention. Incorporating event data, such as\nroad maintenance, offers more profound insights. The model's practical\napplicability and potential to improve traffic safety measures were validated\nby a high level of agreement among researchers in the field of traffic safety,\nas reflected in questionnaire results with 88.89%. This research highlights the\ncomplex nature of traffic crashes and how LLMs can be used for comprehensive\nanalysis of crash causation and other contributing factors. Moreover, it\nprovides valuable insights and potential countermeasures to aid planners and\npolicymakers in developing more effective and efficient traffic safety\npractices."}

Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs\nrepresent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,\nrepresentations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur\nwith varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss\nscaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only\nthe most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of\nloss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature\nfrequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong\nsuperposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,\nthe loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide\nrange of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is\nexplained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower\ndimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales\ninversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced\nLLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match\nthe predictions of our toy model.

It effectively narrows the domain gap between prior patterns,\nenhancing generalization across varying scenarios. Second, we develop a\nconditioned monocular depth estimation (MDE) model to refine the inherent noise\nof depth priors. By conditioning on the normalized pre-filled prior and\nprediction, the model further implicitly merges the two complementary depth\nsources. Our model showcases impressive zero-shot generalization across depth\ncompletion, super-resolution, and inpainting over 7 real-world datasets,\nmatching or even surpassing previous task-specific methods. More importantly,\nit performs well on challenging, unseen mixed priors and enables test-time\nimprovements by switching prediction models, providing a flexible\naccuracy-efficiency trade-off while evolving with advancements in MDE models."}

In this paper, the limitations of\nconventional experimental methods used to derive component-level and locally\nlinear parameter-varying models are discussed and addressed by employing\nidentification techniques based on data collected from standard engine\noperation under closed-loop control. The rotor dynamics were estimated using\nthe sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. Subsequently, the autonomous\npart of the dynamics was mapped into an optimally constructed Koopman\neigenfunction space. The process included eigenvalue optimization using\nmetaheuristic algorithms and temporal projection, followed by gradient-based\neigenfunction identification. The resulting Koopman model was validated against\nan in-house reference component-level model. A globally optimal nonlinear\nfeedback controller and a Kalman estimator were then designed in the\neigenfunction space and compared to the classical and gain-scheduled\nproportional-integral controllers, as well as a proposed internal model control\napproach. The eigenmode structure allowed targeting individual modes during the\noptimization process, resulting in a better performance tuning.

We apply $P$ diverse and\nlearnable transformations to the input, execute forward passes of the model in\nparallel, and dynamically aggregate the $P$ outputs.

However, the problem of repetitions during the\ngeneration process continues to linger. Previous work has primarily focused on\ncontent repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition\nproblem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is\nstructural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in\nvarious patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently\nreflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition\nand propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for\nRepetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems\nin code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to\nidentify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically\ndecays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions,\nthereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we\nconstruct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches\nfor mitigating the repetition problems in code generation.

Tokenadapt initializes new unique token embeddings via a\nhybrid heuristic that combines two methods: a local estimate based on subword\ndecomposition using the old tokenizer, and a global estimate utilizing the\ntop-k semantically similar tokens from the original vocabulary. This\nmethodology aims to preserve semantics while significantly minimizing\nretraining requirements. Empirical investigations validate both contributions:\nthe transplantation heuristic successfully initializes unique tokens, markedly\noutperforming conventional baselines and sophisticated methods including\nTranstokenizer and ReTok, while our Supertokens achieve notable compression\ngains. Our zero-shot perplexity results demonstrate that the TokenAdapt hybrid\ninitialization consistently yields lower perplexity ratios compared to both\nReTok and TransTokenizer baselines across different base models and newly\ntrained target tokenizers. TokenAdapt typically reduced the overall perplexity\nratio significantly compared to ReTok, yielding at least a 2-fold improvement\nin these aggregate scores."}

While traditional category learning models represent each\nexample as an unstructured feature vector, compositional concept learning is\nthought to depend on (1) structured representations of examples (e.g., directed\ngraphs consisting of objects and their relations) and (2) the identification of\nshared relational structure across examples through analogical mapping. Here,\nwe introduce Probabilistic Schema Induction (PSI), a prototype model that\nemploys deep learning to perform analogical mapping over structured\nrepresentations of only a handful of examples, forming a compositional concept\ncalled a schema. In doing so, PSI relies on a novel conception of similarity\nthat weighs object-level similarity and relational similarity, as well as a\nmechanism for amplifying relations relevant to classification, analogous to\nselective attention parameters in traditional models. We show that PSI produces\nhuman-like learning performance and outperforms two controls: a prototype model\nthat uses unstructured feature vectors extracted from a deep learning model,\nand a variant of PSI with weaker structured representations. Notably, we find\nthat PSI's human-like performance is driven by an adaptive strategy that\nincreases relational similarity over object-level similarity and upweights the\ncontribution of relations that distinguish classes. These findings suggest that\nstructured representations and analogical mapping are critical to modeling\nrapid human-like learning of compositional visual concepts, and demonstrate how\ndeep learning can be leveraged to create psychological models."}

In real-world applications, models are\ntypically fixed after training. However, domain shifts caused by changes in the\nenvironment, sensor types, or sensor degradation often lead to a decline in\nmodel performance. Continuous Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) offers a solution by\nadapting a source-pretrained model to evolving, unlabeled target domains.\nDespite its potential, research on ALS point clouds remains limited, facing\nchallenges such as the absence of standardized datasets and the risk of\ncatastrophic forgetting and error accumulation during prolonged adaptation. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose APCoTTA, the first CTTA method tailored for\nALS point cloud semantic segmentation. We propose a dynamic trainable layer\nselection module. This module utilizes gradient information to select\nlow-confidence layers for training, and the remaining layers are kept frozen,\nmitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further reduce error accumulation, we\npropose an entropy-based consistency loss. By losing such samples based on\nentropy, we apply consistency loss only to the reliable samples, enhancing\nmodel stability. In addition, we propose a random parameter interpolation\nmechanism, which randomly blends parameters from the selected trainable layers\nwith those of the source model.

However, recent empirical work has shown that humans vary\nenormously in what they consider commonsensical; thus what appears self-evident\nto one benchmark designer may not be so to another. Here, we propose a novel\nmethod for evaluating common sense in artificial intelligence (AI),\nspecifically in large language models (LLMs), that incorporates empirically\nobserved heterogeneity among humans by measuring the correspondence between a\nmodel's judgment and that of a human population.

To better understand the\ninterplay between these learning modes, we draw inspiration from evolutionary\nbiology's analogous adaptive strategies: genetic encoding (akin to IWL,\nadapting over generations and fixed within an individual's lifetime) and\nphenotypic plasticity (akin to ICL, enabling flexible behavioral responses to\nenvironmental cues). In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability\ndictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic\nencoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We\nexperimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and\nsystematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in\nTransformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high\nenvironmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp\ntransition at maximal stability.

Furthermore, learning dynamics\nreveal task-contingent temporal evolution: while a canonical ICL-to-IWL shift\noccurs in some settings (e.g., classification with many classes), we\ndemonstrate that scenarios with easier IWL (e.g., fewer classes) or slower ICL\nacquisition (e.g., regression) can exhibit an initial IWL phase later yielding\nto ICL dominance.

In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability\ndictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic\nencoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We\nexperimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and\nsystematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in\nTransformers.

In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability\ndictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic\nencoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We\nexperimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and\nsystematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in\nTransformers.

Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs\nrepresent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,\nrepresentations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur\nwith varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss\nscaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only\nthe most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of\nloss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature\nfrequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong\nsuperposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,\nthe loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide\nrange of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is\nexplained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower\ndimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales\ninversely with that dimension.

We introduce the third and\nmore inference-efficient scaling paradigm: increasing the model's parallel\ncomputation during both training and inference time. We apply $P$ diverse and\nlearnable transformations to the input, execute forward passes of the model in\nparallel, and dynamically aggregate the $P$ outputs. This method, namely\nparallel scaling (ParScale), scales parallel computation by reusing existing\nparameters and can be applied to any model structure, optimization procedure,\ndata, or task. We theoretically propose a new scaling law and validate it\nthrough large-scale pre-training, which shows that a model with $P$ parallel\nstreams is similar to scaling the parameters by $O(\\log P)$ while showing\nsuperior inference efficiency. For example, ParScale can use up to 22$\\times$\nless memory increase and 6$\\times$ less latency increase compared to parameter\nscaling that achieves the same performance improvement.

Existing data\nreconstruction attacks have important limitations: they often rely on\nassumptions about the clients' data distribution or their efficiency\nsignificantly degrades when batch sizes exceed just a few tens of samples.\n  In this work, we introduce a novel data reconstruction attack that overcomes\nthese limitations. Our method leverages a new geometric perspective on fully\nconnected layers to craft malicious model parameters, enabling the perfect\nrecovery of arbitrarily large data batches in classification tasks without any\nprior knowledge of clients' data. Through extensive experiments on both image\nand tabular datasets, we demonstrate that our attack outperforms existing\nmethods and achieves perfect reconstruction of data batches two orders of\nmagnitude larger than the state of the art."}

In this paper, we formally define structural repetition\nand propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for\nRepetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems\nin code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to\nidentify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically\ndecays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions,\nthereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we\nconstruct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches\nfor mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that RPG substantially outperforms the\nbest-performing baselines on CodeRepetEval dataset as well as HumanEval and\nMBPP benchmarks, effectively reducing repetitions and enhancing the quality of\ngenerated code."}

In our experiments starting from randomly initialized\npolicies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much\nlower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies\n(MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework\nthat reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy.\nBy treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned\non pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and\ngradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when\ntraining from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency\nand final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot\ncontrol and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results\nshow that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the\nDiffusion Policy."}

However,\ndiffusion models still routinely generate images that would not exist in\nreality, such as a dog floating above the ground or with unrealistic texture\nartifacts. We define the concept of feasibility as whether attributes in a\nsynthetic image could realistically exist in the real-world domain; synthetic\nimages containing attributes that violate this criterion are considered\ninfeasible. Intuitively, infeasible images are typically considered\nout-of-distribution; thus, training on such images is expected to hinder a\nmodel's ability to generalize to real-world data, and they should therefore be\nexcluded from the training set whenever possible. However, does feasibility\nreally matter? In this paper, we investigate whether enforcing feasibility is\nnecessary when generating synthetic training data for CLIP-based classifiers,\nfocusing on three target attributes: background, color, and texture. We\nintroduce VariReal, a pipeline that minimally edits a given source image to\ninclude feasible or infeasible attributes given by the textual prompt generated\nby a large language model. Our experiments show that feasibility minimally\naffects LoRA-fine-tuned CLIP performance, with mostly less than 0.3% difference\nin top-1 accuracy across three fine-grained datasets. Also, the attribute\nmatters on whether the feasible/infeasible images adversarially influence the\nclassification performance. Finally, mixing feasible and infeasible images in\ntraining datasets does not significantly impact performance compared to using\npurely feasible or infeasible datasets."}

Notably, reasoning skills acquired in one domain transfer\neffectively to others; the performance gap with conventional methods widens as\nproblem difficulty increases, with gains of up to 8 points on the most\nchallenging problems. Furthermore, models trained with hidden thoughts learn to\nadjust the depth of their reasoning according to problem difficulty."}

While data\naugmentation techniques are widely used to address these challenges,\ntraditional visually consistent augmentation strategies lack the robustness\nneeded for diverse real-world scenarios. In this work, we systematically\nevaluate alternative augmentation strategies, focusing on MixUp and Auxiliary\nFourier Augmentation. These methods mitigate the effects of multiple variations\nwithout explicitly targeting specific sources of distribution shifts. We\ndemonstrate how these techniques significantly improve out-of-distribution\ngeneralization and robustness to imaging variations across a wide range of\ntransformations in cardiac cine MRI and prostate MRI segmentation. We\nquantitatively find that these augmentation methods enhance learned feature\nrepresentations by promoting separability and compactness.

Although previous works on fingerspelling recognition have focused on\nprocessing the temporal dimension of videos, there remains room for improving\nthe accuracy of these approaches. This paper introduces HandReader, a group of\nthree architectures designed to address the fingerspelling recognition task.\nHandReader$_{RGB}$ employs the novel Temporal Shift-Adaptive Module (TSAM) to\nprocess RGB features from videos of varying lengths while preserving important\nsequential information. HandReader$_{KP}$ is built on the proposed Temporal\nPose Encoder (TPE) operated on keypoints as tensors. Such keypoints composition\nin a batch allows the encoder to pass them through 2D and 3D convolution\nlayers, utilizing temporal and spatial information and accumulating keypoints\ncoordinates. We also introduce HandReader_RGB+KP - architecture with a joint\nencoder to benefit from RGB and keypoint modalities. Each HandReader model\npossesses distinct advantages and achieves state-of-the-art results on the\nChicagoFSWild and ChicagoFSWild+ datasets. Moreover, the models demonstrate\nhigh performance on the first open dataset for Russian fingerspelling, Znaki,\npresented in this paper.

This latter capacity is captured by\nempowerment, which has served as a vital framing concept across artificial\nintelligence and cognitive science. This former capacity, however, is equally\nfoundational: In what ways, and to what extent, can an agent be influenced by\nwhat it observes? In this paper, we ground this concept in a universal\nagent-centric measure that we refer to as plasticity, and reveal a fundamental\nconnection to empowerment. Following a set of desiderata on a suitable\ndefinition, we define plasticity using a new information-theoretic quantity we\ncall the generalized directed information. We show that this new quantity\nstrictly generalizes the directed information introduced by Massey (1990) while\npreserving all of its desirable properties. Our first finding is that\nplasticity is the mirror of empowerment: The agent's plasticity is identical to\nthe empowerment of the environment, and vice versa. Our second finding\nestablishes a tension between the plasticity and empowerment of an agent,\nsuggesting that agent design needs to be mindful of both characteristics. We\nexplore the implications of these findings, and suggest that plasticity,\nempowerment, and their relationship are essential to understanding agency."}

However, the problem of repetitions during the\ngeneration process continues to linger. Previous work has primarily focused on\ncontent repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition\nproblem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is\nstructural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in\nvarious patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently\nreflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition\nand propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for\nRepetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems\nin code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to\nidentify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically\ndecays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions,\nthereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we\nconstruct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches\nfor mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that RPG substantially outperforms the\nbest-performing baselines on CodeRepetEval dataset as well as HumanEval and\nMBPP benchmarks, effectively reducing repetitions and enhancing the quality of\ngenerated code."}
