Springer", "summary": "Steganography is the process of embedding secret information discreetly\nwithin a carrier, ensuring secure exchange of confidential data. The Adaptive\nPixel Value Differencing (APVD) steganography method, while effective,\nencounters certain challenges like the \"unused blocks\" issue. This problem can\ncause a decrease in security, compromise the embedding capacity, and lead to\nlower visual quality. This research presents a novel steganographic strategy\nthat integrates APVD with pseudorandom pixel selection to effectively mitigate\nthese issues. The results indicate that the new method outperforms existing\ntechniques in aspects of security, data hiding capacity, and the preservation\nof image quality. Empirical results reveal that the combination of APVD with\npseudorandom pixel selection significantly enhances key image quality metrics\nsuch as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Universal Image Quality Index (UIQ),\nand Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), surpassing other contemporary methods\nin performance. The newly proposed method is versatile, able to handle a\nvariety of cover and secret images in both color and grayscale, thereby\nensuring secure data transmission without compromising the aesthetic quality of\nthe image."}

CNTMF represents a proposed extension of\nestablished methodologies like STRIDE, OWASP Top 10, NIST frameworks, LINDDUN,\nand PASTA, while incorporating tailored components including Hybrid Layer\nAnalysis, the CRYPTOQ mnemonic for cryptocurrency-specific risks, and an\nAI-Augmented Feedback Loop. Drawing on real-world data from 2025 incidents,\nCNTMF supports data-driven mitigation to reduce losses, which totalled\napproximately $2.47 billion in the first half of 2025 across 344 security\nevents (CertiK via GlobeNewswire, 2025; Infosecurity Magazine, 2025).

Both regimes rely on feedback\nloops that decode internal states into tokens only to re-encode them in\nsubsequent steps. While this \"thinking aloud\" mirrors human reasoning,\nbiological brains iterate without externalising intermediate states as\nlanguage. To boost the expressive power of encoder Transformers without\nresorting to token-level autoregression, we introduce the SELF-Transformer: an\nencoder layer that iteratively refines its own attention weights to a fixed\npoint. Instead of producing -- in one pass -- the alignment matrix that remixes\nthe input sequence, the SELF-Transformer iteratively updates that matrix\ninternally, scaling test-time computation with input difficulty.

This paper presents PHASE (Passive Human Activity Simulation\nEvaluation), a machine learning framework that analyzes Zeek connection logs\nand distinguishes human from non-human activity with over 90\\% accuracy. PHASE\noperates entirely passively, relying on standard network monitoring without any\nuser-side instrumentation or visible signs of surveillance. All network\nactivity used for machine learning is collected via a Zeek network appliance to\navoid introducing unnecessary network traffic or artifacts that could disrupt\nthe fidelity of the simulation environment. The paper also proposes a novel\nlabeling approach that utilizes local DNS records to classify network traffic,\nthereby enabling machine learning analysis. Furthermore, we apply SHAP (SHapley\nAdditive exPlanations) analysis to uncover temporal and behavioral signatures\nindicative of genuine human users. In a case study, we evaluate a synthetic\nuser persona and identify distinct non-human patterns that undermine behavioral\nrealism. Based on these insights, we develop a revised behavioral configuration\nthat significantly improves the human-likeness of synthetic activity yielding a\nmore realistic and effective synthetic user persona."}

The world is arguably made up, not of pixels, words, and phonemes\nbut of entities (objects, things, including events) with properties and\nrelations among them. Surely we should model these, not the perception or\ndescription of them. You might suspect that concentrating on modeling words and\npixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is in terms of text\nand images. If you look into almost any company you will find their most\nvaluable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational formats. These\nare not the form that are studied in introductory machine learning, but are\nfull of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers and other\nidentifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers. The field that\nstudies this sort of data has various names including relational learning,\nstatistical relational AI, and many others. This paper explains why relational\nlearning is not taking over the world -- except in a few cases with restricted\nrelations -- and what needs to be done to bring it to it's rightful prominence."}

To accelerate development of transparent, reproducible,\nand robust AI solutions, we present Glucose-ML, a collection of 10 publicly\navailable diabetes datasets, released within the last 7 years (i.e., 2018 -\n2025). The Glucose-ML collection comprises over 300,000 days of continuous\nglucose monitor (CGM) data with a total of 38 million glucose samples collected\nfrom 2500+ people across 4 countries.

While recent advances in LLMs show\npromise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low\nsuccess rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an\nautomated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.\n  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task:\ntrained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250\nCUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the\nmodel also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,\nachieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,\nx14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.\nBeyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable\nproperties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns\nto combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers\nfundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious\nperformance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that\nharm performance.\n  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can\ntransform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer\nthrough speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain\nknowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning\nabilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated\noptimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU\nefficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources."}
