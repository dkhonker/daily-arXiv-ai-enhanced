However, we observe that these reasoning paths tend to include\nsubstantial redundancy; analyzing attention patterns reveals that attention\nscores are widely scattered, particularly incorrect answers exhibit greater\nattention sparsity. In this paper, we demonstrate that deliberately removing\nthis redundancy in the reasoning process significantly improves performance\nthrough clear thinking, i.e., removing distraction. Specifically, we\nsystematically identify reasoning redundancy by measuring token-level attention\nscores to a special end-of-thinking token, which is appended to an explicit\ninstruction inserted to conclude each intermediate reasoning step. Furthermore,\nwe propose structure-aware pruning that prioritizes removing tokens in\nlow-contributing reasoning chunks over individual tokens. After evicting\nredundant tokens, we remove the injected end-of-thinking instruction, then\nresume the reasoning generation. We demonstrate that our method significantly\nimproves overall accuracy across reasoning-intensive benchmarks without any\ntraining involved. In particular, our method shows strong performance on\nchallenging mathematical competition benchmarks such as AIME and AMC, where\nreasoning redundancy is more prevalent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u9664\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u7bc7\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6563\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u7b54\u6848\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e3a\u660e\u663e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cftoken\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u6b8a\u7ed3\u675f\u601d\u8003\u6807\u8bb0\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u63a8\u7406\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u79fb\u9664\u4f4e\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5757\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e2atoken\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u7ade\u8d5b\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u5982AIME\u548cAMC\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u9664\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u4f55\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}
