In this study, we propose an ontology-guided, equation-centric framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs) with an additive manufacturing mathematical knowledge graph (AM-MKG) to enable reliable knowledge extraction and principled extrapolative modeling. By explicitly encoding equations, variables, assumptions, and their semantic relationships within a formal ontology, unstructured literature is transformed into machine-interpretable representations that support structured querying and reasoning. LLM-based equation generation is further conditioned on MKG-derived subgraphs, enforcing physically meaningful functional forms and mitigating non-physical or unstable extrapolation trends. To assess reliability beyond conventional predictive uncertainty, a confidence-aware extrapolation assessment is introduced, integrating extrapolation distance, statistical stability, and knowledge-graph-based physical consistency into a unified confidence score. Results demonstrate that ontology-guided extraction significantly improves the structural coherence and quantitative reliability of extracted knowledge, while subgraph-conditioned equation generation yields stable and physically consistent extrapolations compared to unguided LLM outputs.

In this study, we examine the effects of personality steering on cooperative behavior in LLM agents using repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Based on the Big Five framework, we first measure basic personality profiles of three models, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, using the Big Five Inventory. We then compare behavior under baseline and personality-informed conditions, and further analyze the effects of independently manipulating each personality dimension to extreme values. Our results show that agreeableness is the dominant factor promoting cooperation across all models, while other personality traits have limited impact.

While existing methods could leverage databases of expert-curated enzyme-substrate pairs for models to learn from known pair interactions, the databases are often sparse, i.e., there are only limited and incomplete examples of such pairs, and also labor-intensive to maintain. This lack of sufficient training data significantly hinders the ability of traditional enzyme prediction models to generalize to unseen interactions. In this work, we try to exploit chemical reaction equations from domain-specific databases, given their easier accessibility and denser, more abundant data. However, interactions of multiple compounds, e.g., educts and products, with the same enzymes create complex relational data patterns that traditional models cannot easily capture. To tackle that, we represent chemical reaction equations as triples of (educt, enzyme, product) within a knowledge graph, such that we can take advantage of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to infer missing enzyme-substrate pairs for graph completion. Particularly, in order to capture intricate relationships among compounds, we propose our knowledge-enhanced hypergraph model for enzyme prediction, i.e., Hyper-Enz, which integrates a hypergraph transformer with a KGE model to learn representations of the hyper-edges that involve multiple educts and products. Also, a multi-expert paradigm is introduced to guide the learning of enzyme-substrate interactions with both the proposed model and chemical reaction equations.

To disentangle failure modes, we employ a dual-protocol design: Batch Generation, where a model produces N=1000 samples within one response, and Independent Requests, comprising $N=1000$ stateless calls. We observe a sharp protocol asymmetry: batch generation achieves only modest statistical validity, with a 13% median pass rate, while independent requests collapse almost entirely, with 10 of 11 models passing none of the distributions. Beyond this asymmetry, we reveal that sampling fidelity degrades monotonically with distributional complexity and aggravates as the requested sampling horizon N increases. Finally, we demonstrate the propagation of these failures into downstream tasks: models fail to enforce uniform answer-position constraints in MCQ generation and systematically violate demographic targets in attribute-constrained text-to-image prompt synthesis.

Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how \"rare\" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes.

While observing the decision-making process of these activities is difficult via traditional travel surveys, the advent of new types of data, such as unstructured chat data, can help shed some light on these complex processes. However, interpreting these decision-making processes requires inferring both explicit and implicit factors. This typically involves the labor-intensive task of manually annotating dialogues to capture context-dependent meanings shaped by the social and cultural norms. This study evaluates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and complement human annotation in interpreting decision-making processes from group chats, using data on joint eating-out activities in Japan as a case study. We designed a prompting framework inspired by the knowledge acquisition process, which sequentially extracts key decision-making factors, including the group-level restaurant choice set and outcome, individual preferences of each alternative, and the specific attributes driving those preferences. This structured process guides the LLM to interpret group chat data, converting unstructured dialogues into structured tabular data describing decision-making factors. To evaluate LLM-driven outputs, we conduct a quantitative analysis using a human-annotated ground truth dataset and a qualitative error analysis to examine model limitations. Results show that while the LLM reliably captures explicit decision-making factors, it struggles to identify nuanced implicit factors that human annotators readily identified. We pinpoint specific contexts when LLM-based extraction can be trusted versus when human oversight remains essential.

We conduct experiments with two speech LLMs, Phi-4 and Qwen3-Omni, on three diverse endangered languages. Firstly, we find that MICL is effective for unseen languages, leveraging both speech and text modalities.

Using two romanizers with different fidelity profiles, we observe negligible performance loss for languages with segmental scripts, whereas languages with morphosyllabic scripts (Chinese and Japanese) suffer degradation that higher-fidelity romanization mitigates but cannot fully recover.

Our analysis reveals two consistent signatures of correct citation: a significantly stronger contribution from the model's parametric knowledge and greater use of the attention sink for information synthesis.

Specifically, we use a high-level router to select among candidate LLM architectures, and then search for the optimal parameters for the selected architectures based on a low-level router. We design a parameter generation network to share parameters between the two routers to mutually enhance their capabilities.

Inference-time ensembling provides a practical way to combine these capabilities without retraining. However, existing ensemble approaches suffer from fundamental limitations. Most rely on fixed fusion granularity, which lacks the flexibility required for mid-generation adaptation and fails to adapt to different generation characteristics across tasks. To address these challenges, we propose AdaFuse, an adaptive ensemble decoding framework that dynamically selects semantically appropriate fusion units during generation. Rather than committing to a fixed granularity, AdaFuse adjusts fusion behavior on the fly based on the decoding context, with words serving as basic building blocks for alignment. To be specific, we introduce an uncertainty-based criterion to decide whether to apply ensembling at each decoding step. Under confident decoding states, the model continues generation directly. In less certain states, AdaFuse invokes a diversity-aware scaling strategy to explore alternative candidate continuations and inform ensemble decisions. This design establishes a synergistic interaction between adaptive ensembling and test-time scaling, where ensemble decisions guide targeted exploration, and the resulting diversity in turn strengthens ensemble quality. Experiments on open-domain question answering, arithmetic reasoning, and machine translation demonstrate that AdaFuse consistently outperforms strong ensemble baselines, achieving an average relative improvement of 6.88%.

To our knowledge, no prior work quantifies these cost savings or compares caching strategies for multi-turn agentic tasks. We present a comprehensive evaluation of prompt caching across three major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google) and compare three caching strategies, including full context caching, system prompt only caching, and caching that excludes dynamic tool results. We evaluate on DeepResearchBench, a multi-turn agentic benchmark where agents autonomously execute real-world web search tool calls to answer complex research questions, measuring both API cost and time to first token (TTFT) across over 500 agent sessions with 10,000-token system prompts. Our results demonstrate that prompt caching reduces API costs by 45-80% and improves time to first token by 13-31% across providers. We find that strategic prompt cache block control, such as placing dynamic content at the end of the system prompt, avoiding dynamic traditional function calling, and excluding dynamic tool results, provides more consistent benefits than naive full-context caching, which can paradoxically increase latency.
