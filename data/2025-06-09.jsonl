Classical model selection\nmethods, such as information criteria and cross-validation, rely heavily on the\nstationarity assumption and often fail in dynamic environments which undergo\ngradual or abrupt changes over time. Yet real-world data are rarely stationary,\nand model selection under nonstationarity remains a largely open problem. To\ntackle this challenge, we combine conformal inference with model confidence\nsets to develop a procedure that adaptively selects models best suited to the\nevolving dynamics at any given time. Concretely, the MPS updates in real time a\nconfidence set of candidate models that covers the best model for the next time\nperiod with a specified long-run probability, while adapting to nonstationarity\nof unknown forms. Through simulations and real-world data analysis, we\ndemonstrate that MPS reliably and efficiently identifies optimal models under\nnonstationarity, an essential capability lacking in offline methods. Moreover,\nMPS frequently produces high-quality sets with small cardinality, whose\nevolution offers deeper insights into changing dynamics. As a generic\nframework, MPS accommodates any data-generating process, data structure, model\nclass, training method, and evaluation metric, making it broadly applicable\nacross diverse problem settings."}

To address these limitations, we\npropose a sequential procedure to orient undirected edges in a completed\npartial DAG (CPDAG), representing an equivalence class of DAGs, by leveraging\nthe pairwise additive noise model (PANM) to identify their causal directions.\nWe prove that this procedure can recover the true causal DAG assuming a\nrestricted ANM. Building on this result, we develop a novel constraint-based\nalgorithm for learning causal DAGs under nonlinear ANMs. Given an estimated\nCPDAG, we develop a ranking procedure that sorts undirected edges by their\nadherence to the PANM, which defines an evaluation order of the edges. To\ndetermine the edge direction, we devise a statistical test that compares the\nlog-likelihood values, evaluated with respect to the competing directions, of a\nsub-graph comprising just the candidate nodes and their identified parents in\nthe partial DAG.

However,\nmost existing methods rely on uniform or heuristic bitwidth assignments,\nfailing to account for the nonuniform sensitivity of weights to quantization\nnoise. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for allocating quantization\nbitwidths based on sensitivity metrics derived from a Hessian proxy. We make\nkey assumptions, which allow the layer/component-wise loss function to be\nexpressed as an explicit function of the bitwidths. This enables a neat\nformulation of the bit allocation problem as a convex optimization task, whose\nclosed-form solution adapts precision across weights to minimize the layer-wise\nquantization loss. Inspecting the solution provides several insights (such as\nthe equal-loss structure), which are then exploited to design the proposed\n\\textbf{BAQ} (Bit Allocation Quantization) algorithm. The proposed algorithm\nachieves a good trade-off between loss minimization and complexity and allows\nBAQ to be integrated into standard quantization pipelines with minimal\noverhead.

However, existing CL methods often\nassume that the agent's capabilities remain static within dynamic environments,\nwhich doesn't reflect real-world scenarios where capabilities dynamically\nchange. This paper introduces a new and realistic problem: Continual Learning\nwith Dynamic Capabilities (CL-DC), posing a significant challenge for CL\nagents: How can policy generalization across different action spaces be\nachieved? Inspired by the cortical functions, we propose an Action-Adaptive\nContinual Learning framework (AACL) to address this challenge. Our framework\ndecouples the agent's policy from the specific action space by building an\naction representation space. For a new action space, the encoder-decoder of\naction representations is adaptively fine-tuned to maintain a balance between\nstability and plasticity.

A rigorous theoretical foundation\nis established based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which\nelucidates the denoising properties of DMs in mitigating additive white\nGaussian noise (AWGN) in latent semantic representations. Crucially, a\nclosed-form analytical relationship between the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and\nthe denoising timestep is derived, enabling the optimal selection of diffusion\nparameters for any given channel condition. To address the distribution\nmismatch between the received signal and the DM's training data, a\nmathematically principled scaling mechanism is introduced, ensuring robust\nperformance across a wide range of SNRs without requiring model fine-tuning.\nBuilt upon this theoretical insight, we develop a latent diffusion model\n(LDM)-based semantic transceiver, wherein a variational autoencoder (VAE) is\nemployed for efficient semantic compression, and a pretrained DM serves as a\nuniversal denoiser. Notably, the proposed architecture is fully training-free\nat inference time, offering high modularity and compatibility with large-scale\npretrained LDMs. This design inherently supports zero-shot generalization and\nmitigates the challenges posed by out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive\nexperimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly\noutperforms conventional neural-network-based semantic communication baselines,\nparticularly under low SNR conditions and distributional shifts, thereby\nestablishing a promising direction for GAI-driven robust semantic transmission\nin future 6G systems."}

IAM achieves strong\nperformance in binary inclusion tests for exact unlearning and high correlation\nfor approximate unlearning--scalable to LLMs using just one pre-trained shadow\nmodel. We theoretically analyze how IAM's scoring mechanism maintains\nperformance efficiently. We then apply IAM to recent approximate unlearning\nalgorithms, revealing general risks of both over-unlearning and\nunder-unlearning, underscoring the need for stronger safeguards in approximate\nunlearning systems.

This paper bridges this\ngap by deriving and analyzing conservation laws for modern architectures, with\na focus on convolutional ResNets and Transformer networks. For this, we first\nshow that basic building blocks such as ReLU (or linear) shallow networks, with\nor without convolution, have easily expressed conservation laws, and no more\nthan the known ones. In the case of a single attention layer, we also\ncompletely describe all conservation laws, and we show that residual blocks\nhave the same conservation laws as the same block without a skip connection. We\nthen introduce the notion of conservation laws that depend only on a subset of\nparameters (corresponding e.g. to a pair of consecutive layers, to a residual\nblock, or to an attention layer). We demonstrate that the characterization of\nsuch laws can be reduced to the analysis of the corresponding building block in\nisolation. Finally, we examine how these newly discovered conservation\nprinciples, initially established in the continuous gradient flow regime,\npersist under discrete optimization dynamics, particularly in the context of\nStochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)."}

Despite their potential, current LLM agents often adopt a\none-size-fits-all approach, lacking the flexibility to respond to users'\nvarying needs and preferences. This limitation motivates us to develop\nPersonaAgent, the first personalized LLM agent framework designed to address\nversatile personalization tasks. Specifically, PersonaAgent integrates two\ncomplementary components - a personalized memory module that includes episodic\nand semantic memory mechanisms; a personalized action module that enables the\nagent to perform tool actions tailored to the user. At the core, the persona\n(defined as unique system prompt for each user) functions as an intermediary:\nit leverages insights from personalized memory to control agent actions, while\nthe outcomes of these actions in turn refine the memory. Based on the\nframework, we propose a test-time user-preference alignment strategy that\nsimulate the latest n interactions to optimize the persona prompt, ensuring\nreal-time user preference alignment through textual loss feedback between\nsimulated and ground-truth responses. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that\nPersonaAgent significantly outperforms other baseline methods by not only\npersonalizing the action space effectively but also scaling during test-time\nreal-world applications. These results underscore the feasibility and potential\nof our approach in delivering tailored, dynamic user experiences."}

Existing methods rely on fixed conservative policies, restricting\nadaptivity and generalization. To address this, we propose Reflect-then-Plan\n(RefPlan), a novel doubly Bayesian offline model-based (MB) planning approach.\nRefPlan unifies uncertainty modeling and MB planning by recasting planning as\nBayesian posterior estimation. At deployment, it updates a belief over\nenvironment dynamics using real-time observations, incorporating uncertainty\ninto MB planning via marginalization. Empirical results on standard benchmarks\nshow that RefPlan significantly improves the performance of conservative\noffline RL policies. In particular, RefPlan maintains robust performance under\nhigh epistemic uncertainty and limited data, while demonstrating resilience to\nchanging environment dynamics, improving the flexibility, generalizability, and\nrobustness of offline-learned policies."}
