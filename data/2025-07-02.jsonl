Recently, masked time-series modeling\nhas been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by\nreconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic\ninformation in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations\ngenerated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series\nignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious\ntemporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal\nsemantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled\npatterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a\nmasked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which\nincludes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that\nincorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a\nperiod masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked\nseasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking\nstrategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar\nvariations. The proposed masking method presents an effective pre-training task\nfor learning intricate temporal variations and dependencies. Additionally,\nST-MTM introduces a contrastive learning task to support masked modeling by\nenhancing contextual consistency among multiple masked seasonal\nrepresentations.

Recently, masked time-series modeling\nhas been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by\nreconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic\ninformation in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations\ngenerated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series\nignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious\ntemporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal\nsemantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled\npatterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a\nmasked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which\nincludes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that\nincorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a\nperiod masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked\nseasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking\nstrategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar\nvariations. The proposed masking method presents an effective pre-training task\nfor learning intricate temporal variations and dependencies. Additionally,\nST-MTM introduces a contrastive learning task to support masked modeling by\nenhancing contextual consistency among multiple masked seasonal\nrepresentations. Experimental results show that our proposed ST-MTM achieves\nconsistently superior forecasting performance compared to existing masked\nmodeling, contrastive learning, and supervised forecasting methods."}

Recently, masked time-series modeling\nhas been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by\nreconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic\ninformation in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations\ngenerated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series\nignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious\ntemporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal\nsemantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled\npatterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a\nmasked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which\nincludes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that\nincorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a\nperiod masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked\nseasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking\nstrategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar\nvariations.

Among the methods proposed to solve this task,\nthose relying on patterns (i.e. subgraphs) provide good explainability, as the\npatterns used for classification can be directly interpreted. To identify\nmeaningful patterns, a standard approach is to use a quality measure, i.e. a\nfunction that evaluates the discriminative power of each pattern. However, the\nliterature provides tens of such measures, making it difficult to select the\nmost appropriate for a given application. Only a handful of surveys try to\nprovide some insight by comparing these measures, and none of them specifically\nfocuses on graphs. This typically results in the systematic use of the most\nwidespread measures, without thorough evaluation. To address this issue, we\npresent a comparative analysis of 38 quality measures from the literature. We\ncharacterize them theoretically, based on four mathematical properties. We\nleverage publicly available datasets to constitute a benchmark, and propose a\nmethod to elaborate a gold standard ranking of the patterns.

The few\nexisting approaches in open-ended ASD select hypotheses based on diversity\nheuristics or subjective proxies for human interestingness, but the former\nstruggles to meaningfully navigate the typically vast hypothesis space, and the\nlatter suffers from imprecise definitions. This paper presents AutoDS -- a\nmethod for open-ended ASD that instead drives scientific exploration using\nBayesian surprise. Here, we quantify the epistemic shift from the LLM's prior\nbeliefs about a hypothesis to its posterior beliefs after gathering\nexperimental results. To efficiently explore the space of nested hypotheses,\nour method employs a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) strategy with progressive\nwidening using surprisal as the reward function. We evaluate AutoDS in the\nsetting of data-driven discovery across 21 real-world datasets spanning domains\nsuch as biology, economics, finance, and behavioral science. Our results\ndemonstrate that under a fixed budget, AutoDS substantially outperforms\ncompetitors by producing 5--29\\% more discoveries deemed surprising by the LLM.\nOur human evaluation further finds that two-thirds of AutoDS discoveries are\nsurprising to the domain experts, suggesting this is an important step forward\ntowards building open-ended ASD systems."}

However, PbRL can\nsuffer from slow convergence speed since it requires training in a reward\nmodel. Prior work has proposed learning a reward model from demonstrations and\nfine-tuning it using preferences. However, when the model is a neural network,\nusing different loss functions for pre-training and fine-tuning can pose\nchallenges to reliable optimization. In this paper, we propose a method to\neffectively leverage prior knowledge with a Residual Reward Model (RRM). An RRM\nassumes that the true reward of the environment can be split into a sum of two\nparts: a prior reward and a learned reward. The prior reward is a term\navailable before training, for example, a user's ``best guess'' reward\nfunction, or a reward function learned from inverse reinforcement learning\n(IRL), and the learned reward is trained with preferences. We introduce\nstate-based and image-based versions of RRM and evaluate them on several tasks\nin the Meta-World environment suite. Experimental results show that our method\nsubstantially improves the performance of a common PbRL method. Our method\nachieves performance improvements for a variety of different types of prior\nrewards, including proxy rewards, a reward obtained from IRL, and even a\nnegated version of the proxy reward.

To address these\nlimitations, we introduce xHAIM (Explainable HAIM), a novel framework\nleveraging Generative AI to enhance both prediction and explainability through\nfour structured steps: (1) automatically identifying task-relevant patient data\nacross modalities, (2) generating comprehensive patient summaries, (3) using\nthese summaries for improved predictive modeling, and (4) providing clinical\nexplanations by linking predictions to patient-specific medical knowledge.\nEvaluated on the HAIM-MIMIC-MM dataset, xHAIM improves average AUC from 79.9%\nto 90.3% across chest pathology and operative tasks. Importantly, xHAIM\ntransforms AI from a black-box predictor into an explainable decision support\nsystem, enabling clinicians to interactively trace predictions back to relevant\npatient data, bridging AI advancements with clinical utility."}

We prove that major existing approaches target identical\npopulation functionals under squared-error loss, revealing why they share this\ncorrelation-induced bias.\n  To address this limitation, we introduce \\emph{Disentangled Feature\nImportance (DFI)}, a nonparametric generalization of the classical $R^2$\ndecomposition via optimal transport. DFI transforms correlated features into\nindependent latent variables using a transport map, eliminating correlation\ndistortion. Importance is computed in this disentangled space and attributed\nback through the transport map's sensitivity. DFI provides a principled\ndecomposition of importance scores that sum to the total predictive variability\nfor latent additive models and to interaction-weighted functional ANOVA\nvariances more generally, under arbitrary feature dependencies.\n  We develop a comprehensive semiparametric theory for DFI. For general\ntransport maps, we establish root-$n$ consistency and asymptotic normality of\nimportance estimators in the latent space, which extends to the original\nfeature space for the Bures-Wasserstein map. Notably, our estimators achieve\nsecond-order estimation error, which vanishes if both regression function and\ntransport map estimation errors are $o_{\\mathbb{P}}(n^{-1/4})$. By design, DFI\navoids the computational burden of repeated submodel refitting and the\nchallenges of conditional covariate distribution estimation, thereby achieving\ncomputational efficiency."}

Existing methods for node-level privacy either focus\nexclusively on query-based approaches, which restrict output to pre-specified\nnetwork statistics, or fail to preserve key structural properties of the\nnetwork. In this work, we propose GRAND (Graph Release with Assured Node\nDifferential privacy), which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first\nnetwork release mechanism that releases entire networks while ensuring\nnode-level differential privacy and preserving structural properties.

We investigate whether LLMs can develop strategic\nreasoning capabilities through RL in chess. To this end, we leverage a\nchess-pretrained action-value network to provide dense reward on the LLM's\noutput move quality, which can be seen as a form of knowledge distillation. Our\nexperiments show that our distillation-based dense rewards often outperform\nsparse binary rewards. However, surprisingly, all models plateau far below\nexpert levels. We provide SFT and RL ablations on chess reasoning training and\nfind evidence that this limitation stems from a deficit in the pretrained\nmodels' internal understanding of chess--a deficit which RL alone may not be\nable to fully overcome."}

Algorithms to\nsolve the PW problems already exist, however we extend the PW framework by\ndiscussing and testing several initialization strategies.
