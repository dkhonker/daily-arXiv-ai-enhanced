We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to\nreason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first\nprompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to\ndisclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning\n(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to\nachieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\\sim700$\nexamples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show\nthat our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure\nwhile maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.\nImportantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established\nCI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates\nprivacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls."}

Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice\nevaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback\nthen guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data\ngeneration process.

We further characterize how AI agent design choices, such as\nfew-shot prompting, reflection depth, and parallel reasoning, impact\naccuracy-cost tradeoffs. Our findings reveal that while agents improve accuracy\nwith increased compute, they suffer from rapidly diminishing returns, widening\nlatency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs. Through detailed\nevaluation of representative agents, we highlight the profound computational\ndemands introduced by AI agent workflows, uncovering a looming sustainability\ncrisis. These results call for a paradigm shift in agent design toward\ncompute-efficient reasoning, balancing performance with deployability under\nreal-world constraints."}

Despite the substantial\nempirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular\nunderstanding of their advantages is still lacking. To address this gap, we\nintroduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on\nreasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been\nhypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2)\nproblem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.\nUsing this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance,\nproviding models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades\nperformance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit\ngreater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their\nbase counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the\nexecution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow\ninternal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes. Conversely, we\nobserve that RL enhances the model's capacity to integrate provided knowledge\ninto its reasoning process, leading to performance improvements across diverse\ntasks.

However, current approaches face two key limitations:\ntheir self-improvement processes are often rigid, fail to generalize across\ntasks domains, and struggle to scale with increasing agent capabilities. We\nargue that effective self-improvement requires intrinsic metacognitive\nlearning, defined as an agent's intrinsic ability to actively evaluate, reflect\non, and adapt its own learning processes. Drawing inspiration from human\nmetacognition, we introduce a formal framework comprising three components:\nmetacognitive knowledge (self-assessment of capabilities, tasks, and learning\nstrategies), metacognitive planning (deciding what and how to learn), and\nmetacognitive evaluation (reflecting on learning experiences to improve future\nlearning). Analyzing existing self-improving agents, we find they rely\npredominantly on extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms, which are fixed,\nhuman-designed loops that limit scalability and adaptability. Examining each\ncomponent, we contend that many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are\nalready present.

However, at their core these models are\nstill RNNs, and thus their use of a fixed-size hidden state to model the\ncontext is a fundamental limitation. This paper develops log-linear attention,\nan attention mechanism that balances linear attention's efficiency and the\nexpressiveness of softmax attention. Log-linear attention replaces the\nfixed-size hidden state with a logarithmically growing set of hidden states. We\nshow that with a particular growth function, log-linear attention admits a\nsimilarly matmul-rich parallel form whose compute cost is log-linear in\nsequence length. Log-linear attention is a general framework and can be applied\non top of existing linear attention variants.

Specifically, we identify the impact of a\nkey family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call\ncross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust\nclassification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a\nsynthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model\narchitectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the\nmodel tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness\ncheckpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust\noverfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific\nfeatures. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two\nexisting properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and\nrobust overfitting.

We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to\nreason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first\nprompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to\ndisclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning\n(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to\nachieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\\sim700$\nexamples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show\nthat our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure\nwhile maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.\nImportantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established\nCI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates\nprivacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls."}

However, creating the training dataset for their skill\nacquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires\nsignificant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks\nto learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are\nactually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful\nlearning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To\naddress this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for\nLLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target\nbehaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an\nexploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train\nthe target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.\nSpecifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively\ngenerate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to\ntrain Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice\nevaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback\nthen guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data\ngeneration process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's\nability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the\ncapabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving\nsubstantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting\nAlice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating\nEXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system."}
