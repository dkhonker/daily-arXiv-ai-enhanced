To address these challenges, we\nintroduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse\nexperiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for\nautonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts,\nDreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model\nthat derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through\nstep-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To\nimprove the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an\nexperience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and\ncontinuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent\ntraining. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new\ntasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online\ncurriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent\nbackbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in\nfully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready\ntasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in\nRL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only\nsynthetic interactions.
