Tokenized Graph\nLearning Models (TGLMs) address this issue by converting graphs into ordered\ntoken lists for scalable processing. Besides, TGLMs also empower Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to handle text-attributed graphs more effectively and thus are\nalso employed in Graph LLMs. However, existing TGLMs rely on hand-designed\ntoken lists and their adaptability to diverse graph learning scenarios remains\nunexplored. In this paper, we first conduct extensive empirical and theoretical\npreliminary studies for hand-designed token lists. Surprisingly, we identify an\nunexplored hop-overpriority problem: the common pre-defined token lists\noveremphasize nearby nodes and overwhelm the ability of TGLMs to balance local\nand global signals. This phenomenon is especially harmful for heterophilic\ngraphs. To address this problem, we propose the Learnable Graph Token List\n(LGTL), a plug-and-play module to replace hand-designed token lists in TGLMs.\nSpecifically, LGTL adaptively adjusts the weights across hops and prioritizes\ninformative nodes within hops through a graph attention gate module and a\nselection module, respectively. In this way, contextually informative nodes can\nbe adaptively emphasized for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Besides,\nwe theoretically show that LGTL can address the hop-overpriority problem.\nExtensive experiments on benchmarks validate the efficacy of LGTL across both\nGraph Transformers and Graph LLM backbones."}

In contrast, epistemic uncertainty (EU) -- due to incomplete\nknowledge -- requires richer representations than those offered by classical\nprobability. Imprecise probability (IP) theory offers such models, capturing\nambiguity and partial belief. This has driven growing interest in imprecise\nprobabilistic machine learning (IPML), where inference and decision-making rely\non broader uncertainty models -- highlighting the need for metrics beyond\nclassical probability. This work introduces the Integral Imprecise Probability\nMetric (IIPM) framework, a Choquet integral-based generalisation of classical\nIntegral Probability Metric (IPM) to the setting of capacities -- a broad class\nof IP models encompassing many existing ones, including lower probabilities,\nprobability intervals, belief functions, and more. Theoretically, we establish\nconditions under which IIPM serves as a valid metric and metrises a form of\nweak convergence of capacities. Practically, IIPM not only enables comparison\nacross different IP models but also supports the quantification of epistemic\nuncertainty within a single IP model. In particular, by comparing an IP model\nwith its conjugate, IIPM gives rise to a new class of EU measures -- Maximum\nMean Imprecision -- which satisfy key axiomatic properties proposed in the\nUncertainty Quantification literature. We validate MMI through selective\nclassification experiments, demonstrating strong empirical performance against\nestablished EU measures, and outperforming them when classical methods struggle\nto scale to a large number of classes. Our work advances both theory and\npractice in IPML, offering a principled framework for comparing and quantifying\nepistemic uncertainty under imprecision."}

While some research has exploited\nthe locality of expert activations, where consecutive tokens activate similar\nexperts, the degree of this **local routing consistency** varies across models\nand remains understudied. In this paper, we propose two metrics to measure\nlocal routing consistency of MoE models: (1) **Segment Routing Best Performance\n(SRP)**, which evaluates how well a fixed group of experts can cover the needs\nof a segment of tokens, and (2) **Segment Cache Best Hit Rate (SCH)**, which\nmeasures the optimal segment-level cache hit rate under a given cache size\nlimit.

By analyzing weight matrices from\nboth empirical and theoretical perspectives, we find that label inaccuracy\nprimarily accumulates noise in lower singular components and subtly perturbs\nthe principal subspace. Within a certain range, the principal subspaces of\nweights trained on inaccurate labels remain largely aligned with those learned\nfrom clean labels, preserving essential task-relevant information. We formally\nprove that the angles of principal subspaces exhibit minimal deviation under\nmoderate label inaccuracy, explaining why models can still generalize\neffectively. Building on these insights, we propose LIP, a lightweight plug-in\ndesigned to help classifiers retain principal subspace information while\nmitigating noise induced by label inaccuracy. Extensive experiments on tasks\nwith various inaccuracy conditions demonstrate that LIP consistently enhances\nthe performance of existing algorithms. We hope our findings can offer valuable\ntheoretical and practical insights to understand of model robustness under\ninaccurate supervision."}

A core challenge in RLHF is constructing accurate reward signals,\nwhere the conventional Bradley-Terry reward models (BT RMs) often suffer from\nsensitivity to data size and coverage, as well as vulnerability to reward\nhacking. Generative reward models (GenRMs) offer a more robust alternative by\ngenerating chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales followed by a final reward.\nHowever, existing GenRMs rely on shallow, vertically scaled reasoning, limiting\ntheir capacity to handle nuanced or complex (e.g., reasoning-intensive) tasks.\nMoreover, their pairwise preference outputs are incompatible with standard RLHF\nalgorithms that require pointwise reward signals. In this work, we introduce\nThink-RM, a training framework that enables long-horizon reasoning in GenRMs by\nmodeling an internal thinking process. Rather than producing structured,\nexternally provided rationales, Think-RM generates flexible, self-guided\nreasoning traces that support advanced capabilities such as self-reflection,\nhypothetical reasoning, and divergent reasoning. To elicit these reasoning\nabilities, we first warm-up the models by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over\nlong CoT data.

In addition,\nextended code-only RL iterations further improve performance on code benchmarks\nwith minimal or no degradation in math results. We develop a robust data\ncuration pipeline to collect challenging prompts with high-quality, verifiable\nanswers and test cases to enable verification-based RL across both domains.\nFinally, we identify key experimental insights, including curriculum learning\nwith progressively increasing response lengths and the stabilizing effect of\non-policy parameter updates. We find that RL not only elicits the foundational\nreasoning capabilities acquired during pretraining and supervised fine-tuning\n(e.g., distillation), but also pushes the limits of the model's reasoning\nability, enabling it to solve problems that were previously unsolvable."}

While existing evaluations of SAEs\nfocus on metrics such as the reconstruction-sparsity tradeoff, human\n(auto-)interpretability, and feature disentanglement, they overlook a critical\naspect: the robustness of concept representations to input perturbations. We\nargue that robustness must be a fundamental consideration for concept\nrepresentations, reflecting the fidelity of concept labeling. To this end, we\nformulate robustness quantification as input-space optimization problems and\ndevelop a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring realistic scenarios in\nwhich adversarial perturbations are crafted to manipulate SAE representations.\nEmpirically, we find that tiny adversarial input perturbations can effectively\nmanipulate concept-based interpretations in most scenarios without notably\naffecting the outputs of the base LLMs themselves.

A major obstacle in calibrating PoLMs is the scarcity of labeled\ndata for individual downstream tasks. To address this, we propose\nDisagreement-Aware Confidence Alignment (DACA), a novel unsupervised method to\noptimize the parameters (e.g., temperature $\\tau$) in post-hoc confidence\ncalibration. Our method is motivated by the under-confidence issue caused by\nprediction disagreement between the PLM and PoLM while aligning their\nconfidence via temperature scaling. Theoretically, the PLM's confidence\nunderestimates PoLM's prediction accuracy on disagreement examples, causing a\nlarger $\\tau$ and producing under-confident predictions. DACA mitigates this by\nselectively using only agreement examples for calibration, effectively\ndecoupling the influence of disagreement. In this manner, our method avoids an\noverly large $\\tau$ in temperature scaling caused by disagreement examples,\nimproving calibration performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method, improving the average ECE of open-sourced and\nAPI-based LLMs (e.g. GPT-4o) by up to 15.08$\\%$ on common benchmarks."}

This assumption is crucial: if, on the contrary, the weights are\nsufficiently large, then oversmoothing may not happen. Theoretically, GNN could\nthus learn to not oversmooth. However it does not really happen in practice,\nwhich prompts us to examine oversmoothing from an optimization point of view.\nIn this paper, we analyze backward oversmoothing, that is, the notion that\nbackpropagated errors used to compute gradients are also subject to\noversmoothing from output to input. With non-linear activation functions, we\noutline the key role of the interaction between forward and backward smoothing.\nMoreover, we show that, due to backward oversmoothing, GNNs provably exhibit\nmany spurious stationary points: as soon as the last layer is trained, the\nwhole GNN is at a stationary point. As a result, we can exhibit regions where\ngradients are near-zero while the loss stays high.

To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first diffusion-based framework to operate independently of\ndiscretization, offering a practical and flexible solution for forward and\ninverse problems in the context of PDEs.

Besides manually constructing prompts, many prompt optimization methods\nhave been proposed in the literature. Method development is mainly empirically\ndriven, with less emphasis on a conceptual understanding of prompting. In this\npaper we discuss how optimal prompting can be understood through a Bayesian\nview, which also implies some fundamental limitations of prompting that can\nonly be overcome by tuning weights. The paper explains in detail how\nmeta-trained neural networks behave as Bayesian predictors over the pretraining\ndistribution, whose hallmark feature is rapid in-context adaptation. Optimal\nprompting can be studied formally as conditioning these Bayesian predictors,\nyielding criteria for target tasks where optimal prompting is and is not\npossible. We support the theory with educational experiments on LSTMs and\nTransformers, where we compare different versions of prefix-tuning and\ndifferent weight-tuning methods. We also confirm that soft prefixes, which are\nsequences of real-valued vectors outside the token alphabet, can lead to very\neffective prompts for trained and even untrained networks by manipulating\nactivations in ways that are not achievable by hard tokens. This adds an\nimportant mechanistic aspect beyond the conceptual Bayesian theory."}

This paper develops a statistical theory\nof learning under CoT supervision. A key characteristic of the CoT setting, in\ncontrast to standard supervision, is the mismatch between the training\nobjective (CoT risk) and the test objective (end-to-end risk). A central part\nof our analysis, distinguished from prior work, is explicitly linking those two\ntypes of risk to achieve sharper sample complexity bounds. This is achieved via\nthe *CoT information measure* $\\mathcal{I}_{\\mathcal{D},\nh_\\star}^{\\mathrm{CoT}}(\\epsilon; \\calH)$, which quantifies the additional\ndiscriminative power gained from observing the reasoning process.

In particular, we establish Poincar\\'{e} and log-Sobolev inequalities\nfor the joint distribution of the output labels and the label-weighted input\nvectors, which we apply to derive concentration bounds. The derived\nconcentration bounds are sharp up to moderate multiplicative constants by those\nunder well-balanced labels. In asymptotic analysis, we also show that almost\nsure convergence of uniform generalization errors to their expectation occurs\nin very broad settings, such as proportionally high-dimensional regimes. Using\nthis convergence, we establish uniform laws of large numbers under\ndimension-free conditions."}

Most existing approaches focus primarily on textual reasoning,\noverlooking the critical role of structured and interpretable visualizations in\nsupporting conceptual understanding. To better assess the visual reasoning\ncapabilities of FMs in educational settings, we introduce EduVisBench, a\nmulti-domain, multi-level benchmark. EduVisBench features diverse STEM problem\nsets requiring visually grounded solutions, along with a fine-grained\nevaluation rubric informed by pedagogical theory. Our empirical analysis\nreveals that existing models frequently struggle with the inherent challenge of\ndecomposing complex reasoning and translating it into visual representations\naligned with human cognitive processes. To address these limitations, we\npropose EduVisAgent, a multi-agent collaborative framework that coordinates\nspecialized agents for instructional planning, reasoning decomposition,\nmetacognitive prompting, and visualization design. Experimental results show\nthat EduVisAgent substantially outperforms all baselines, achieving a 40.2%\nimprovement and delivering more educationally aligned visualizations.\nEduVisBench and EduVisAgent are available at\nhttps://github.com/aiming-lab/EduVisBench and\nhttps://github.com/aiming-lab/EduVisAgent."}

In this study, we propose a statistical testing\nframework to rigorously evaluate the significance of saliency maps. Our main\ncontribution lies in addressing the inflation of the Type I error rate caused\nby double-dipping of data, leveraging the framework of Selective Inference. Our\nmethod provides statistically valid $p$-values while controlling the Type I\nerror rate, ensuring that identified salient subgraphs contain meaningful\ninformation rather than random artifacts.
